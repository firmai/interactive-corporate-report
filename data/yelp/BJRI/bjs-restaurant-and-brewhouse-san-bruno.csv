Tiffany L.,"Burlingame, CA",109,114,427,4.0,1/4/2018,"This BJ's is located inside the Tanforan mall, so there's almost always a long wait at dinner time. I've been here a few times with my family and we usually have had to wait around 40 minutes for a table, but you can walk around the mall while you wait and they text you when your table is ready. BJ's has a huge menu, with lots of options for everyone. They have vegetarian/vegan, gluten-free, low calorie, etc. options to choose from. One of my favorite entrees is the kale and roasted brussels sprouts salad ($10.95). They're pretty generous with the brussel sprouts, fruits, and other toppings. I've also enjoyed their vegetarian-style Peruvian quinoa bowl, Italiano vegetable penne, and vegetarian deep dish pizza before. Their pizookies are a delicious way to end your meal. All the flavors are delicious, but they are super sweet and rich, so bring a friend to share with!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno
Al a.,"San Francisco, CA",52,17,6,2.0,1/4/2018,"Food wasn't great and it wasn't bad. Service started great. Really fast to get our drinks and our salad....then all came down hill.  Waited a long time for our food to come out, they forgot to make my girlfriends food... so we waited an extra 15 min while my food got cold. After that our server went MIA for such a long time we just decided to ask for the check and leave. Taqueria near my house has better attention to their customers.

Geny K.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,19,5,5.0,12/27/2017,"We love coming here for drinks and hanging out at the bar.  The appetizers are pretty good, like the boneless sry siracha chicken wings.  The drinks are good too.  As for the entries they could use more seasoning on some of their items.

Em P.,"San Francisco, CA",503,163,127,2.0,11/21/2017,"We came at 6:30 pm which we knew was going to be busy so we were prepared to wait but not for that long!!! They reception desk told us that we would get a text in 30 minutes that our table way ready but it was actually more like 50 minutes. We were seated at 7:30 pm and waited another 15 minutes to be noticed by our server. He got out our appetizer order, drinks, and entrees. We were waiting for our appetizers to come out and to our surprise the appetizers came with our entrees! Hmm totally defeats the purpose of appetizers. To make matters worse, the appetizers were cold and they got my order wrong. SMH... Long story short I talked to the manager and he gave us the appetizers for free or so we thought. When the. I'll came the appetizers were still in the bill so I again flagged our server to resolve the issues.  It was such a tedious time! We did not leave until 9:40 pm and that was mostly the waiting period. I'm pretty disappointed with my experience here which is a bummer as they usually have better food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno

Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4988,2340,4479,3.0,12/8/2017,"The featured draft, Grand Cru, has me coming back often (to any and all BJ's locations), skipping all the way from my car to my table, then after a couple of hours, staggering and falling to my car.  With a 10.00% ABV (alcohol by volume), in itself, is staggering. The beer, the pizza, and the PIZOOKIE: =============================== There known, mainly, for these 3 things.  They have nice selection of their own brand of beers, and name brands (with my aforementioned Cru).  The pizza (Chicago-style and a few flatbreads) is good, but not great (it's thick like focaccia, but in no way close to buttery biscuit-like from Chicago).  The PIZOOKIE is a must, a hot cookie with a scoop of ice cream -- believe me, INCREDIBLE, 8 flavors to choose from plus a monkey bread, too. For food, worthy items: ================== 1.  BBQ Chicken Chop Salad [$13.95, 5.0 stars] -- You can never go wrong with this, it's perhaps the best anywhere (CPK and Wood Ranch are the other worthy places).   2.  Southern Comfort Crispy Chicken Sandwich [$12.95, 5.0 stars] -- this could not be a better sandwich, it's perfect.  Crispy fried chicken, slice of ham, bacon, Swiss cheese, Alfredo sauce, Dijon, and a great toasted bun, and it's served with fries! 3.  Root beer glazed ribs [$10.75, 4.5 stars] -- 5 baby back pork ribs with a sticky root beer glaze with a side slaw.  Best, as a snack or appetizer, too good to share. 4.  New Orleans Jambalaya [$18.50, 4.5 stars] -- Chicken breast, shrimp, chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, all in a spicy Cajun broth.  So good!  Location specific: San Bruno, CA ============================= * The food is consistent with any other BJ's locations, but the service is not.  Minimal, forgetful, slow -- not how any restaurant should be remembered.  For that, it makes it an average experience. * Attached the The Shops at Tanforan mall.  Parking is odd from the Target side, but plentiful near the BJ's entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno
Derek L.,"Daly City, CA",479,69,403,1.0,9/27/2017,"Credit to the manager who was able to address our frustration with the terrible hosting job and the waitress who served us throughout the night!  I'm sorry but I still have to leave negative feedback so that this issue can be brought up and not happen to others. Originally my party of 14 had made a reservation at 6:45pm earlier in that day.  Once we arrived, the hostess assured us that the table would be ready in 30 minutes.  30 minutes pass.  No table.  So we ask again.  The hostess tells us to wait another 30 minutes.  Apparently, the party at ""our"" table wasn't leaving yet which I can understand.   We grow hangry so my friend goes around to the back to see that there is an empty table set.  We grow suspicious whether or not that table could be for us.  So once again we ask the hostess and she claims it's for another reservation.  Alright, we wait some more.  At this point were debating whether or not we should just go eat at the food court.  But we've waited so long so might as well wait a little longer.  Another 30 minutes pass. Finally, she seats us at the exact table we had asked about. Horrible management on their part.  What should of been at max a 2 hour experience dragged out to 4.  No one wants to spend 4 hours at a restaurant. Especially not BJ's. Thankfully, the manager subsidized us with complimentary appetizers and desserts.  Still upset and frustrated about the whole experience.  We had to cancel our plans afterwards because it had already gotten too late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno
Danielle S.,"Pacifica, CA",285,43,61,5.0,9/20/2017,"Came back again for that 50% large pizza deal this past Monday night and it was very crowded! It looks like the news about their weekly discount deals has definitely gotten around because it took a 25-30 minute wait for my party of three. I totally didn't mind it though -- a crowded lively BJ's is much more of an enjoyable environment compared to a half empty one.  I just wanted to give an update at how much the service had improved the second time around. The servers were so much better this time around. My friend had spilled her raspberry lemonade on the table and he was kind enough to bring us a few towels to wipe it up. It would've been nice if he helped us clean up the table himself, but I mean we are big girls we can clean up our own messes. We all got unlimited drinks (strawberry lemonade and raspberry lemonade), so refills were free, but the nice thing this time was I actually got a good number of refills! I placed my empty cup at the edge of the table and within minutes a server was walking by asking if we wanted a refill. Much better service compared to the last Monday I spent here.  At the end of the night there was a mistake on our bill (they didn't price the pizza half off!) but my server fixed it quickly and it wasn't a problem.  Overall, had a good time with a great white and limitless drinks and I'd love to come back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno
Alan F.,"Hercules, CA",67,383,62,4.0,11/14/2017,"I stopped in at the bar Sunday afternoon; big, happy crowd, many in NFL adornment.  However, as I have my priorities, my interest centered not on the on-screen action, but on BJ's rotating seasonal:  the 18th annual edition of their Grand Cru, in the style of a Belgian tripel or strong golden ale (the  boundary between the two styles is indistinct).  10% ABV, 11 IBU.  Slightly hazy amber, one-finger head, served in its own logo glasswear.  Nose is winy and ester-y, with a touch of ripe peach.  Taste is sweet malt, banana esters, and antihistamine, with a definite alcohol warmth.  Quite nice, and a bargain at $4.00; happy hour prices apply to all house beers during NFL broadcasts.  At 10%, one goes a long way. Surprisingly, the Niners won.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno
Libby J.,"Los Altos, CA",299,730,281,4.0,11/11/2017,"If you aren't a friendly feller, I suggest you not sit at the bar at BJ's because you are elbow to elbow with your neighbor. And if you don't want to wait then I suggest you avoid BJ's. If you do not mind either of these -- you are ready for deep dish pizzas, pizookies, and lots of beer and sports. I mean what's there to say about BJ's? Big tv's with sports, lots of beers, expansive menu, lots of calorically dense and greasy food. It's a chain.  The atmosphere is noisy, lots of families, lots of sports fan, lots of large groups. The floors here are soooo slippery -- I was wearing boots and felt like I was on a slip and slide.  You can frequent the minimal stores in the mall while you wait or before and after (Barnes and Nobles here!). This also brings me to my PSA (parking service announcement). Thanks the heavens for ample parking here since it is a mall with not too much going on.  In summary, waits, noise, sports, sports food, beer.

Creamy goodness. +The girl waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She made sure to check on us at the right time and was very informative.  -Deep dish pizza was alright, made with fresh ingredients, but seems like a regular pizza more than a deep dish. -Clam chowder was okay, creamy not too flavorful. Added pepper, still felt like it was missing something. +Poozookie, salted caramel was delicious, next time I order it, I would ask them to ease up a bit on the caramel.

Food arrived cold, the waiter took it back but didn't really seem to care, whatever I'm not here to give anyone a hard time. Main course of pasta came before my appetizer which was also cold and missing part of the item (ordered the platter and avocado egg rolls were missing). The waiter brought them separately after he himself didn't notice (he slammed the platter down and left the table so he definitely wouldn't have noticed).

Diana C.,"San Francisco, CA",277,177,404,3.0,7/18/2017,"A little overpriced but for BOGO, sure why not? Definitely a sports bar feel with tv screens overhead and broadcasting basketball games. We sat near the bar which also was near the outside patio if you wish to sit by a fire pit.  The menu is extensive and makes one scratch its head on deciding what to get. We settled on pizza and pasta and got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and a small pizza that we did half/half for toppings - 1/2 Great White and 1/2 Gourmet Five Meat. I didn't realize they were deep dish pizza. I have to say that the Great White was my favorite because I love alfredo sauce. The pasta was good too but pretty simple dish.  I downloaded their app and was able to score a free mini Pizookie and got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. If you show your waiter your app code, you can get points for your meal and you can also pay through mobile. I wasn't sure if he was coming back with a paper receipt so I just ended up paying on the app.  I would probably come back for some pizookie or bar bites/beer for a game or if there's a BOGO happening.

Chandra D.,"Redwood City, CA",62,467,659,3.0,7/11/2017,"Dude. I haven't been to BJ's restaurant in years. When I was younger, my youth group and I used to frequent this place after many church events. It was always open late, affordable, and had a variety of entrées to appease many tastes. After my husband and I watched Hamilton in San Francisco, we took a Lyft back to the San Bruno BART station where husband's car was parked.  It was close to midnight, we were hungry, and the only thing that was open was BJ's. BJ's closes at 1 AM! We were hesitant to go to BJ's because we hadn't been in forever, but since it was open we decide to give it a try. Okay, the food is not that great and there is nothing to write home about. However, if you've just gotten out of a movie at Tanforan, or you're in need of a late night meal, BJ's has got you covered. We started off with spinach artichoke dip, but my husband and I wished we would have skipped the appetizer and had dessert instead. The shrimp tacos I ordered were mediocre at best, and I kind of wished I would have opted to order a pizza. I ordered French fries, and those weren't that good either.  Our waiter was a little spacey, but he was trying to manage multiple tables after midnight, so I gave him a pass. He forgot my fries, and it took him awhile to notice. He also forgot to refill our water glasses. Sadly, I was too full to order a pizookie. That's what I wish I would have ordered. Honestly, this place is a two-star joint, but I gave it three stars because it stays open so late. If you enjoy late nights, like a sports bar feel, and don't care too much about the quality of food, BJ's is a good late-night option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno

Theres usually a long wait of about 20-40 minutes before you are seated, but the wait is definitely worth it. The Ribs are a must!!! I've order the ribs 4/5 times that i've been here & they never disappoint me! The taste of the barbecue sauce has a mixture between sweet & spicy, its delicious!. I also always order the calamari to start.

Michelle S.,"San Francisco, CA",206,156,520,2.0,9/9/2017,"Yikes. So the venue itself is cool.  Nice decor, great vibe.  It looks like it's decorated for adults rather than family - which I like.  So I was excited. But again, yikes.  Food came out super slow.  It took so long we almost asked, and we never ask.  The server also put our appetizers in as entrees...so our apps came out at the same time as our entrees - which was pretty frustrating. Also, two of our dishes were straight up COLD.  Like not kinda cold, like cold. Like my sweet potato fries felt like they'd been sitting out for 30 minutes.  I sent them back and the server didn't seem surprised or apologetic.  Seemed kind of like the norm... The sweet potato fries were good, my fried calamari was okay.  Our garlic knots app was okay...the couscous mac and cheese was okay...everything was okay.   I would not recommend this spot.  Only if you live in the area and your options are limited.  Too bad, seems like it has a lot of potential just misses the mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno
Shubankan J.,"Raleigh, NC",19,12,,5.0,11/16/2017,"Absolutely love this place!! :)  Food: On point. There is such a huge menu with a variety of food options (whether you're feeling pizza, burger/fries, tacos, pasta, being healthy - salads, amazing dessert selection, etc. none of it is too pricey, either.) Drinks: AMAZING!! Where else in the Bay Area can you get a happy hour beer for $4 and well drinks for $5?! The beers BJ's brews are the best (my favorite is the light switch lager as it's low in carbs, smooth taste & you can feel fine drinking more than 1).  Atmosphere: Very clean (bathrooms too), clientele is mostly/usually well dressed, polite & friendly. Bartenders and waiters/waitresses are very nice (but sometimes slow - not their fault though, they're also super busy as the place is always completely packed?)  Prices: VERY GOOD. I suggest whether you're there to watch football, have a beer or just catch up with a friend, you go during happy hour times - the beers, food, appetizers are pretty cheap).  Other: They're pretty accommodating :) I asked them to put on the Panthers game instead of a NBA game that no one was watching & they were more than happy to listen to my request promptly. Other than that, service is usually pretty slow, if you're okay being distracted chatting it up with a friend, watching sports or scrolling Instagram on your phone, this place really doesn't have any ""negatives"".

Personally after trying a handful of entrees I only seem to get the two same things each time I come here Parmesan Chicken and the infamous cookies n' cream Pizookie!  There's always a long wait but it's nice there's a Barnes&Noble and different shops near to roam around until they text you with your table ready!

Came and sat at the bar, ordered through the app, got my food etc. Here is was triggered me; since me and my date were just here for a couple drinks and a pizookie, I thought I would just pay in the app early, since we already had a couple drinks and the pizookie.  Well, after I paid via the app, the server did not come by once ever again. Did not ask if we wanted anything else (we were actually gonna get another drink), or ask if we were ok etc. Anyway, we were there for another 30 minutes after I paid, and she did not come by. She did actually look like she was having a bad day, no smiling, legit just working. Sucks for you missy, but maybe be a bit more professional and not bring your personal life into the work place...

I did really enjoy one of their desserts though which was like a giant cookie with ice cream on top. However, upon my second visit here, I ordered a potato dish that I just couldn't eat.

However,  good service can always make or break an experience.   We arrived last night around 8pm to get a table for 5.  The wait was 90 minutes. However,  bar seating is open and my husband was lucky enough to find us a table.  Although it wasn't cleared from the previous patrons we quickly ran over to proclaim it ours.  Anything is better than waiting 90 min for a table at 8pm when your hungry!  It took about 5 min to get the table cleaned and then a lovely waitress by the name of Sierra came over.  She was upbeat, extremely friendly,  helpful and was interested in making our experience as pleasant as possible under the extreme circumstances of having a full house.   She got drinks and an appitizer to our table as quickly as possible.  It still took an hour to get food but she kept checking on us (but not annoyingly) and kept our drinks full. She really is an awesome server who turned a potentially bad experience into a positive experience.  Thank you Sierra! You are awesome! Having a server like Sierra and consistently good food is why we continue coming to BJ's... even if we have to wait.   Sierra you get 5 stars for your service!   But I have to give an overall experience of 4 stars because we still spent 2.5 hrs there and only 30-40 min of that time was spent eating. #noonelikestowaitthatlong Ps. We did not like the Grand Cru brew at all! It tasted like rubbing alcohol...super strong like someone put 2 shots of cheap vodka in my beer! I Love beer and my husband and I love their Jeremiah Red and Oasis brew. I even like the bitterness of IPA's... but I didn't like the Grand Cru at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=20
Diana G.,"El Granada, CA",3,130,49,3.0,1/29/2017,"Service was excellent. The young lady was very nice. However, the food was just okay. Calamari was minimal. For the price, we should have received an appetizer that could be shared. The size served could have been eaten by one person and they still would have left hungry.  We also order a BJ Favorites Deep Dish  pizza. In my opinion this is not a deep dish pizza and the name should be changed. This is a ""Thick Crust"" pizza and not deep dish. Was disappointed to discover that it was nothing but a bunch of bread with minimal toppings and sauce. It was just okay in flavor. The tomatoes need to me omitted or substituted for fresh tomatoes. They tasted like they were canned tomatoes.  Also had a beer and cider. The carbonation is way off. The cider tasted more like soda.  The stars all go to the young lady (Daniela, I think).  It's okay to come here, but be picky about what you order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=20

She left us with a new waitress in which we were ok with. I had a parmesan chicken last night with mashed potatoes and broccoli! It was good but I did expect the dish to be a little hotter. I had asked for butter to put on my broccoli from my waitress and she forgot (I don't blame her for forgetting once).  I had asked for a water and she forgot again. Ok, that was not what I was expecting. She brought it over and then asked my cousin and I wanted desserts. We told her we'll wait for a few minutes to think on it. She came around literally a few minutes later and we were talking and she barged in just by standing there expecting us to give her what we wanted. It was us that held her up but at least she should've been more considerate in waiting til we were actually ready to order.  We finally ordered the Pizookies and enjoyed them fully! :) Our waitress came and gave us our bill and again, she expected us to hurry and pay it. We were still enjoying our desserts but seriously! She did this at least 3 or 4 other times which made me almost upset that I wasn't going to pay her!  I will eat here again but the service I was given, was just a 5 or less stars.

Ehm.aye T.,"Hercules, CA",67,19,19,1.0,10/25/2017,"I think the only things this place has going for it is that its: -Close to the airport -An alternative to watching a sports event     when Hooters is not an option Last night was the last time my family and I are going to frequent this location. The service was horrible and I will go into further detail as to how last night went. When we got to the hostess desk, she was having a conversation with a server. Judging from the site of it, it did not look business related since the server she was chatting it up with did not even bother to tell the hostess there were people behind her. I told her my group was a party of four; but the hostess there didn't even put is in the system. Another one who was passing by did. The first one was probably new, but I don't think it is justifiable by any means. Wait time was 45 minutes. But after a while the entrance had cleared out of people and there were only two groups of people left. THE HOSTESS WHO DID NOT PUT US IN THE SYSTEM ASKS IF WE WERE WAITING FOR A TABLE. We've only been in the restaurant for the last 30-40 minutes and you saw me come in and you ask me this?!? She says, ""Give me 10 minutes."" We waited and were getting impatient because my mother had a flight to catch soon.  The hostess found us a booth to sit in, but it was still dirty with food particles. She offered to clean it up - With the used napkin on the table and not looking at all the crumbs on the floor of the booth. It was only until the busboy gets the plates and silverware, she got a damp cloth to clean the table. This is just not acceptable, but she apologizes; and we politely accepted.  Our server Michelle seemed a bit apathetic. Maybe it was an off night? Or maybe they were short staffed because someone went on break. I am not sure. I think from the get-go it made our dining experience unpleasant. We actually ended up boxing up our food to go because my Mom was gonna be late for our flight. We weren't even offered dessert! All in all it, seemed like employees at this restaurant seem to be doing their own thing and were not helping each other. Again, perhaps it was on off night. But I will end here and say to my fellow yelpers: you have been warned. Slow, inattentive service.

Their beer is decent, hence the star.  I got a blond ale.  The flavor was better than I'd expected.  I wish I'd just stuck to beer for lunch.

SO wanted to stop here for an early evening dinner before the movies. It started off with waiting 45 minutes for a table. There's almost no seating in the lobby so many patrons just had to stand with kids running around all over the place. Then once we finally got seated and my SO ordered a beer, it was on to more waiting. 15 minutes until our waitress finally came back with the beer and we could order. I remember looking at the clock constantly because I didn't understand how it could take so long to make an appetizer and pour soda on to ice cream. Another 20-30 minutes until our food and my drink came. Finally our California flatbread arrived. It was surprisingly good. Bacon, avocado, and ranch and are a winning combo on anything, but the portion was very small and not filling. Definitely meant to be more of an appetizer. I ordered the orange cream float, that came with free refills, but didn't receive any because our waitress just never looked back after dropping stuff off. It took so long just receive an appetizer and drink, we didn't dare order anything else. We were already late for our movie at that point and just wanted the check. It took 30 minutes to ask for a check and pay. No one paid any attention to us and my SO had to aggressively flag another waiter down. Total of 2 hours. 2 hours to get some flat bread and a drink.

Of the many visits that I have had the shortest wait time was about 20 minutes with an hour being the longest. The food itself is very good especially the deep dish pizza that they have. The burgers are okay but a little dry for my taste. The price is also a little bit high for the quality of the food. I do feel like they make up for this with their happy hour specials that they have. The happy hour specials make it so that when you go eat with a group of friends or family you won't break the bank. The atmosphere of this place feels fast paced with multiple TVs around the restaurant and a small bar that gets rather full very quickly making it a little bit difficult to find seating in this area.

Usually, the food is pretty good here and service so-so, but today the service has been so slow that it is very frustrating. We've been sitting at our table for 30 minutes and we're still waiting for cream and sugar for our coffee even though we've asked our waiter twice. He just put down our appetizer without any plates. Then when he brought us plates it was covered in blue dishwashing liquid. The waiter did not ask me how I wanted my steak and when I remembered, I tried to tell him ""medium"" but he didn't appear for so long; when the steak arrived it was extra rare. Another employee came over and explained that he's the new manager (Clint). He was very apologetic and explained that he knows there are problems, and that him and new management are trying to fix things.

We my guest start to arrive they began seating them and by the time my husband and I got there everyone was happily receiving their orders and eating. The only problem we had was with one waiter who took one of our guest order wrong and long story short was not being very corporative. We let the manager know and he helped us to have a better evening in the end. Everyone in our party had a great time and enjoyed the night.

Tonight, unfortunately, was something of a slight disappointment.  Our waitress was cordial and attentive but also seemingly in a hurry for us to place our order.  (A beautifully illustrated, dissertation-length menu takes a wee bit of time to read.)  Our food took way too long to arrive.  I think there was a distinct shortage of staff for the number of customers in attendance.  My wife's sweet potato fries were cold and mushy in texture.  Her pulled pork burger did not have the advertised SHREDDED pulled pork quality.  Rather, the meat came in the form of large chunks.  Another relative and I both ordered soups: these had the right taste but were luke warm instead of piping hot.  His avocado roll and my California flatbread appetitzers were just spot on fine.  Anyway, we'd really like to a return trip sometime soon, just becuz the fine dining experiences at BJ's of yesteryear are still alive and vibrant in our memory cells.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=120

Anny W.,"San Francisco, CA",426,151,60,2.0,11/5/2016,"Once in a while, I'm craving something hearty. So I suggested to eat here for dinner on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. First off, the wait was 50 minutes. Fine- I get it if the restaurant was packed. I walked by the windows that were faced towards the mall and saw a whole row of empty tables/seats. That could've easily fitted 4 parties of 4 and 4 parties of 2. How is that even efficient? 50 minutes passed and I didn't get a text. I went to check with the host and he got extremely defensive about it: ""Sorry mam. I gave you 50 minutes as a estimated time that you'll be seated. We can't do anything to make it any faster. We have customers who are just sitting there after dinner. You will just have to wait."" That was a total uncalled for response but whatever. My boyfriend and I sat in the waiting area for another 10 minutes. So the total wait time was  WHOLE HOUR. The waiter that served us was not attentive and seemed to be all over the place. We ordered appetizers, soup, beer and two entrees. I can officially reward this BJ to be the longest wait time in the world for an appetizer. We waited a whole 30 mins for Avocado Spring Rolls. To put the cherry on top, we didn't have any utensils OR plates. I had to ask the waiter TWICE for it. Then my boyfriend's beer came, he just slammed it down and walked away! Maybe he felt bad and came back to ""check"" up on us to see how we liked our egg rolls. If you plan on getting the steak with sides of veggies, please do yourself a favor and pass on it. The veggies were really dry and overcooked with no seasoning. I got the bacon avocado burger and my waiter didn't even ask how I wanted my patty to be cooked. I got a well done burger patty and I only eat medium rare! Total fail. When it was time to pay, I asked the waiter for two box and a check. He was wandering around and checking up on tables around us. He saw me glaring at him and he already forgot to give me the things I've asked for. I waved my hands to get his attention to ask where's the box and check? He apologized and said he totally forgot *rolls eyes*. He came back and said the printer ran out of receipt paper so he has to get his manager to re-print it the receipt. This means ANOTHER wait?! Omg someone please pass me a beer. This was my fifth time visiting BJ at this location and I vow to never return. The last time I went, they forgot about utensils, plates and the wait time for the food was ridiculous as well.

The menu changes up every so often. At lunch time there usually is no wait to be seated, but if you have a huge party you may want to call in ahead of time. My favorite deal for lunch is the unlimited soup and salad. I would usually order the Caesar salad and like 3 rounds of clam chowder. There was one time they ran out of clam chowder and we had to sit and wait for 30mins just so they could make a new batch. The other issue is that even if they have it ready, the waiter takes almost 15mins to bring another bowl of soup after the first round. The overall taste is fine, but there's just a lot of waiting to get your food. I do occasionally stop by with my friends for dinner as well. They have pretty good deals for Happy Hour; I think 50% off select appetizers, and cheap drinks. Again, it's pretty hard to flag someone down to put in your orders and then again to pay your bill.

Just from the looks of the spinach and artichoke dip (warm), I already knew it would disappoint. The dip had an extremely liquidy consistency. I can only describe the dish to look like light green milk with bits and pieces of spinach and artichoke. Is there a spinach shortage that I'm unaware of? First thought in my head was there must be lack of staffing in the kitchen.  I had the full rack of ribs (actually hot) with fries and chili. The ribs were the most edible item I had there all night. Fries were doused with salt (extremely over seasoned). The bf had the ribeye steak with Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. After trying a piece of the Brussel sprout, I dare not try the rest. It was probably frozen, reheated, frozen again, and reheated until overcooked.  Granted our beverages came out way later (no refills on waters or soda), our utensils came out way later, and our condiments came out way later, we were shocked we actually even got the items.

It can be really great and consistent and then you'll hit a few waiters or nights in the kitchen where you're like what the heck is this (which I know happens, and that's fine) but on two occasions now the waiter/waitress have done less than impress me to make it right.  1) broccoli and cheddar bread bowl. Instead of coming out to tell me there isn't enough soup I waited until my bfs burger was delivered and beyond with repeated check ins with my waiter. When my crusty half full bowl of soup arrived it arrived without the bread bowl. When I inquired about this I was then brought out a bread bowl on the side...even though my crusty cup of soup was cold and basically done. I was still charged though...I let it slide.  2)tonight, I came in to Mary dianna as my server. I'm writing this complaint with a compliment oriented goal because she knocked my socks off right off the bat. She delivered perfect service from polite greetings, suggestions, service of refills, attitude and personality anddd listening!!!!  I asked for the brussel sprout appetizer with extra sauce but not on the side ideally because it's cold and would taste so much better hot. Her and the cooks delivered! Omg! Soooo yummy 10 stars.  And perhaps Mary Diana and the cooks set the standards too high but when she had to go on lunch break and I attempted to tell it to my new server the results were less than satisfactory.  1- it came out without the extra sauce..honestly less sauce than normal (I come here way too much for this dish) and huge half cuts of dry sprouts that they would normally cut again.  2-after requesting for extra sauce and explaining that I don't like the cold sauce it comes out with the cold sauce on top.  3-after again explaining my poor dish goes in again 1 more time and returns drowned in oil and less sauce than I had to friggen start with.  4-with the look and expression of disappointment to my server about my oily sprouts in the end nothing was done to fix it. I wasn't even asked if I wanted a box for my oily sprouts to take home.  (Server number 8) It doesn't take much to make things right but for $7 I'll think twice about coming here again for the 2nd time in a week with my boyfriend because I don't want bad service.

Bono B.,"San Francisco, CA",6,116,5,4.0,7/24/2017,"Terrific service headed up by Efrom and the other attentive waitstaff along with decent food from the kitchen made an impromptu Sunday night out very enjoyable. I'd say the food is a solid 3.5 based on what we ate, and the great service adds another 0.5 star to the entire dining experience. I normally don't go to chain restaurants (nor give 4 star reviews frequently), but given our situation and choice, it turned out to be a great option. The Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus was nicely fried, with a nice, light crispy batter and a dusting of parmesan cheese on top. The creamy, garlicky and slightly tart aioli that came with the dish was a great foil to the appetizer. As with the fries, the frying on the asparagus was executed well, with no greasiness. The seasonal salad offering of watermelon, pickled red onions, crisp spring salad mix, and feta cheese crumbled on top was a nice, refreshing summer salad. The vinaigrette dressing was nice and tart, and worked well with the sweet flesh of the diced watermelon. The picked onions may have been a tad too salty, tart, and portioned too generously relative to the greens, but all in all, pretty good salad that I'd like to try replicating at home. BJ's Brewhouse Burger was surprisingly tasty. Maybe not as good as my fave burger from NOPA, but the patty was flavorful, the lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles were fresh and were a good match-up for the burger, and the parmesan crusted bun gave the burger a nice, buttery richness. Not exactly like a brioche bun, but in the similar ball-park texture wise. I didn't need to add ketchup or mustard to the burger - it was seasoned very nicely as-is. I would say it's up there with Super Duper and In-and-Out in terms of quality. And I mean this as a compliment without any irony. Those places make a terrific burger, and BJ's burger can go toe-to-toe with them. The accompanying fries were nice and crispy, just as they should be. The Shrimp & Asparagus Penne was the least favorite dish of the evening. I'd have to say the kitchen kind of killed the pasta - it was over al dente, nearly mushy in texture. I wasn't too thrilled with the marinara either. It was much sweeter than I'd prefer - it was almost like they'd put in too much tomato paste in the marinara. They may have been better off just making a simple tomato sauce with olive oil, thinly sliced garlic, black pepper, and sea salt, and sauteeing the shrimp and asparagus very quickly in the end in the sauce. In general, I think the simpler dishes fared well whereas the pasta dish that required more components didn't do so well. Perhaps something to think about as you navigate their menu and order your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=60

Beth A.,"Fresno, CA",18,8,,3.0,1/2/2018,"In town for just the night and needed an easy dinner place before heading over to SFO to pick up incoming family. Found BJ's on Yelp and went on over. New Years Day at 6:45 pm.  Hostess said there would be a 30-40 min wait.  They obviously were short staffed because there were plenty of tables. Got the text 30 mins later and was seated in the back past the roll up doors. Hostess seated us and it was at least 10-15 mins before our waiter showed up.  Our waiter was super nice but it still took another 15 minutes for a H2O and Black Cherry Soda to come out. Placed dinner order when we gave our drink order.  Took probably another 30-40 mins before our plates came out.  I had the Spicy peanut chicken with Soba Noodles and the Mister has the BBQ chopped salad.  Both were very good, but his was missing the bbq sauce. However practically all the tables in our row had issues and needed to talk to a manager.  We ordered the monkey bread pizzookie and it was delish!!!  It took us 2 hours to have dinner and dessert at a BJ's.  I couldn't imagine how a regular night would be.  We'd still be there .  We usually prefer local restaurants but being Jan 1, many were closed so we picked what was familiar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=60

Lynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",215,511,2095,2.0,6/29/2016,"I hardly come to bjs unless im having a pasta craving. I havent gone for awhile and found they discontinued the cajun shrimp pasta. It inclined me to get the chicken fettucine with brocccoli. The pasta was lukewarm. I was so hungry, i let it pass. The pasta wasnt cooked to al dente. It was still hard. There was 4 bits of chicken in it. Dont get me wrong, it was a hefty plate of 2$ worth of pasta. But i expect a chicken breast in a 16$ plate. My bf ordered the ribs with wedges on the side. The ribs were dry and the bbq sauce was subpar. The best thing about dinner was the wedges. They at least made that right, crispy outside, soft inside. He also had clam chowder as well. We expected a small cup of it and were pleased to find it was a large bowl. It was on the salty side but was okay. Didnt come with crackers :( Overall, i have come to the conclusion that bjs is a brewery and specialize in that. The rest is just there. I wouldnt order food unless it was their pizookis or pizza because they specialize in that too and i have had them before just not at this location. If they are going to serve expensive food, they need to make sure every dish they send out is hot and cooked well, not dry, not raw. I dont think ill return for their food.

All three of us ordered burgers. My dad got the bison burger(comes with coleslaw) and my mother and I both got the bacon cheese burger (comes with fries). Immediately upon seeing our dish come, we noticed how greasy the fries were. Little did we know, the fries were the best part (and they were pretty bad).  The burgers were cold.

Lauren C.,"Alhambra, CA",317,27,40,2.0,3/22/2016,"This seems to be the go to place whenever we have large parties to feed. The portions are big and there's a wide selection for food. We almost always have left overs which is great for a midnight snack. I especially love getting their burgers with fries. My favorite is the guacamole burger. It's so filling and their fries are always so crispy and golden.  For appetizers, I love their avocado eggrolls and lettuce wraps. I'm hooked on those two dishes. Lastly, let's not forget about the pazookie! If you've never had one before, it's basically a freshly baked cookie topped off with icecream. I feel like it's a tradition to get a pazookie with every visit. If you're with a couple friens, I'd recommend the Pizookie Trio because then you get to three different pazookies instead of one.  Whenever I'm here, the service is great. I've had some bad experiences in other restaurants where waiters were inattentive and didn't want to deal with such a large group but not at BJ's. Our waiters were always coming in to check up on us and refill our water. I realize it's hard dealing with more than 20 people so I appreciate that they were extremely nice and organized with our party.  The reason for my low review isn't the food but the cleanliness of the utensils and tables. I wish I had more pictures from past experiences but a majority of the times that I have come, I have had to flag down a waiter because there's stains on our utensils or lipstick on the cups.  It's made me extremely paranoid every time I come here. The last time I came, I was about to dip my spoon into my soup when I realized there was some weird red gunk on it. Then I realized it was on some of my other utensils too.

I ordered spinach stuffed mushrooms,... kinda. What came out barely resembled what I thought I was getting. These were mushrooms the way raisins are grapes. The service was good, but the food was so disappointing, even the wings couldn't save this trip.

I also ordered a Caeser salad with extra croutons and dressing.  Come with neither.  Had to ask for the croutons and dressing 2 times and they made it feel like I was bothering them and it was my fault.  Looks like BJ's is going the way of Elephant Bar that was at Serramonte.  Never coming back.  Paid $50 for lousy service and food!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=200

Bryant C.,"San Francisco, CA",210,135,88,1.0,2/23/2016,"A sad shell of what this place used to be, they've kept their pizza and pizooki and streamlined everything else to be the next Cheesecake factory (or possibly Chili's). This place caters to the easy goers looking for a meal already decided for them and the business plan seems to be working out as there is always a wait. It's a comfortable environment to hang out and have a beer, but the restaurant has fallen to the wayside. FOOD: Avocado egg rolls were somehow served to us cold. Maybe they forgot to put it under the little heater as they waited to bring it to us (even though this was the appetizer). The whole thing was overly salted and the texture was as if it had been put into the fridge for a week then reheated. Then left out on the counter to recool. Then served. Stale. Terrible. The jambalaya was pretty flavorless. An incoherent mess of ingredients tried to be brought together in my usual favorite fashion: oil! Unfortunately, it somehow backfired and was terrible. Dirty greasy food is my favorite type of food and they still butchered it. An absolute travesty when compared to elephant bar's. Maybe I'm bitter that they got rid of my 3 favorite things (open faced chili cheese burger, nachos, and shrimp carbonara), but the food they served me was objectively bad. This used to always be a safe bet, but when you drop the ball like this, my opinions change.

The food was okay and better than average for the price.  My friend enjoyed her clam chowder and deep dish pepperoni pizza which I will try next time.  The two apps for two people with entrees were a bit much for us.  She took home about half of the calamari and I did the same with the potato skins.  There were a couple of service inconsistencies that dampened our experience.  Perhaps because we were slow in finishing our apps, the entrees came before we finished our bowls of soup which made the table very small.  Also, in trying to hail our waitress Jacqueline, we had a difficult time finding her as it seemed that she was busy somewhere else.  Looked like she was doing a solo for our area, the window sections had two waiters tending those customers.  Might consider the business flow in assigning the staff. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, a bit cheaper than Jack's, but with a larger selection of food.   Most of my Yelp friends gave two or three stars, but maybe I was just fortunate to catch them on a good day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=200

Definitely don't come here if you have an hour lunch...you're not going to be able to make it back to work in time! I've been to BJ's in other cities, and the food is comparable to the other locations that I've dined at.  At this particular location, I had the country chicken steak, the seared ahi tuna salad, and the clam chowder in the bread bowl.  All were pretty tasty - especially the seared ahi tuna salad, which was surprisingly good.  The clam chowder was not bad either, although it tasted kind of like Progresso's canned chowder.  Hopefully all the food they make is in-house and not anything canned or store bought. Parking can be a nightmare here, only because it's part of Tanforan Mall...so if it's busy with weekend (or holiday) shoppers, parking can be kind of difficult. The times I've come here I've had to park kind of far away... but I guess that might be a blessing in disguise since I can walk off a few extra calories with a farther away parking spot! Overall, this BJ's has a solid three star rating as it offers pretty good tasting food but with slow, slow service.  If you plan to dine in, you should only come here if you have two or more hours to kill.  Not recommended for a quick lunch break unless you're planning to order take out.

The food at BJ's seems to change every now and then, but you can always find something tasty on the menu.  The beers are obviously a focal point and I like the darker end of the taps, but that's neither here nor there. (The new derby cobb salad is pretty darn good and not pre-tossed like the last one, so there's a plus!!!) I wish they had growlers to go, but .... they don't.

They also run certain hh specials during major televised games and parking isn't an issue (located in the tanforan shopping plaza) There really aren't many sports bar options around the area so it's probably your best bet after buffalo wild wings. The food is average - similar to an applebees. The quality is a hit or miss. The wings were fresh out the fryer one time I went and another time it was dry as cardboard. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was delicious - not the best clam chowder but definitely the best bread bowl I've had - baked with garlic butter - mmm. Skip the flatbreads - I've yet to find one that tastes good. The fries are thin shoe string fries - not my thing. The spinach artichoke dip was eh - the cheese looked like ricotta/ chunky and not really melted.  Their craft brews are good - I like the hefeweisen and berry burst cider - the best thing is you can get a beer sampler which comes in 4 small flights - if you like variety this is a great option to sample 4 of their craft beers. The service has always been great so no complaints there. The multiple tv screen set up is pretty nice as well. Overall a good place to a grab a drink and watch the game. Don't set your expectations too high on the food however.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=220
Alex J.,"Burlingame, CA",51,139,63,2.0,6/21/2016,"The BJ's I've been to in the past have all been solid choices (not mind blowing but not disappointing either).  This is the first BJ's that I've been to where I left unhappy.  I went prior to a warriors game hoping to enjoy a beer and watch the warriors game.  I called ahead to make sure I would be able to get a seat and was told that the wait was only 15 minutes.  I reached the restaurant and was told that the wait would be 15 minutes (again).  I left my contact number and received a text 1.5 hours after telling me that my table was ready.  I came back to try the food and called ahead again and was told that another 15 minute wait would be ahead of me.  My girlfriend placed her name on the call ahead list on the app and we were seated immediately (very strange).  Once seated, the service was a little slow.  We placed our order and the food arrived (slowly).  We ordered the seared ahi salad, shrimp and asparagus penne, and the fried calamari.  The fried calamari was small but good.  The seared ahi dressing was a bit strong (if you do order, dressing on the side might be a smart choice).  The shrimp and asparagus penne was strange; the it seemed like the dish was slopped onto the plate.  I think they should have remade it because there were BLACKENED asparagus tips in the pasta (clarification: blacked on one side and green on the other side).  Our waiter (who was a social butterfly and seemed to tend to the larger parties that were seated next to us) refilled our water, but I kept on noticing black specks in our water....they might have been using a Brita filter which would explain it, but nothing that i couldn't scoop out.  But on a good note: Pazookies are good...yum.... TL;DR:  Not the best food...sometimes solid flavors but perhaps sloppily prepared with semi slow service...Pazkookies are the good point for all BJ's restaurants.  I might recommend going to another BJ's location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=220

We arrived around 5:30ish PM on a Friday and it was a 20 min wait before we got the text notification that there's a table ready for us. I looked around the restaurant and it wasn't all that busy, despite the fact that it's around dinner time.  Our waiter (from what was stated on our bill) was ""Jimmy A"".  A tall gentleman with a man-bun and a tattoo on his neck. It took awhile for him to take our orders, which was fine since I saw him talking to a party of 4, two tables down, across from us. For drinks, I had ordered the refillable strawberry lemonade. I finished it fairly quick since the cup was full of ice. He hadn't offer me any refills until my boyfriend asked. The calamari we ordered tasted old, cold, soggy, and the batter was falling off. We had to use our hands since we didn't have utensils on the table. I didn't get the chance to catch his name but a different waiter (tall, slim, African American) had brought out our entrees and he was so apologetic, I wanted to give Jimmy A's tips to him instead.  Not once were we checked up on, but I've seen him with the same table of 4 across from us, at LEAST 5 times. What's up with that? My boyfriend insisted on not leaving a tip, but I still left 15% because I work in the food service industry as well. I would get it if maybe he was having a bad day but the service was so terribly poor, I didn't care enough to put that into consideration anymore.

Lauren W.,"South San Francisco, CA",14,30,17,1.0,6/7/2016,"I swear, EVERYTIME I come here it's a problem. Last time, I was told a 20 minute wait.. I come in 25 mins later.. My food isn't even started being cooked. Because whoever took my order didn't think to mention the Santa Fe rolls are on recall, so they just changed my order to wings.. I walk up to pay and the lady says so what kinda wings you want? Confusing when I never ordered wings & a bit rude to not explain why your asking me about wings. I ask for s manager, he was very understanding and seemed to actually care about the customers feedback which was nice. I came back honestly because he was so genuine & seemed really concerned w/the well being of the staff & store, but god forbid BJs take care of my order properly.  I come in tonight, my food was just sitting on the counter, not in the oven.. For 10 minutes while I waited to even be helped & another 8 for the girl to ""find"" the rest of my order. I asked the lady how long my food had been sitting out & she had hella attitude like ""Uhm only 5 minutes since I just walked up here 2 seconds ago.."" Meanwhile I was already waiting 15 minutes & saw my food sitting on the counter the entire time (just didn't know it was mine)  I get home, they made me the wrong salad, my potato wedges were fried to a crisp with hardly any of the toppings, just Dry potato skin which is disgusting, they didn't give me the side of sour cream either. Plus when I called, I specifically asked them to make sure they were cooked properly b/c if I don't mention it there burned & dry. The SAME girl who had the attitude at the To go table is the girl who took my order & when I asked them to make sure it was cooked w/all the toppings she's like ""Obviously it will be on there if that's what comes with it or I can charge you for extra"" like obviously I wouldn't be asking for it to be cooked properly if there was no chance it would be cooked wrong.  My boyfriend ordered an appetizer plate of chicken tenders yet they gave us a lunch order with fries which isn't what he asked for. The fries that came with it were so chewy & gross. Probably from sitting out for so long  On top of all that horrible food, I figured there's no way they messed up my pizookie.. So I just threw my order in the trash & BOOM! My pizookie & my boyfriends pizookie were burnt. Hard as a rock. Even the ice cream wouldn't soften it up.  Such a waste of $60 .. I would come back & tell the manager, but every time I come here it's like I have to talk to a manager or I won't get treated properly. If I'm a paying customer I should just be treated kindly & have the proper food cooked. Of course slip ups happen. But it is EVERY TIME w/this location. Come to BJs throw your money away on burnt food & help yourself to some crap service & nasty attitude from the Take out girl,  Verryy disappointing !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=240

YOU MUST READ MY REVIEW FOR YOUR SAFETY!  Considering I live in San Bruno, I've only come here three times and the last time I was here was three times too many.  When they first opened, I ordered a salad and wanted steak on it (steak salad). Well I was charged for a large salad plus charged for a steak dinner. Their reasoning was that a steak salad was not on their menu.  Well now it is.  Maybe my complaint made it to the top.  Second time, it took 15 mins to get attended to by a server and 35 min wait for our food. The last time I was here, I ordered the Chicken tortilla soup at 11Am when they first opened as I had a business lunch meeting. It was convenient. I took my first bite and on my second bite something scraped and stabbed my tongue as I forced to keep from swallowing it. OMG! It was a SHARP PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS! Called the server and told her to go to the kitchen and not to serve the soup to anyone then I told her to get her manager.  Filled out an incident report since the glass cut my tongue. They did not charge me for my meal BUT NEVER ASKED ME IF I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT. So my lunch meeting turned into a water drinking meeting. Then the server had the nerve to tell me that I was still welcome to leave anything behind for her?????!!!!!!????? Really! Corporate office sent me a $50 gift certificate. My tongue was sore and swollen for 10 days and I received $50. What a joke! BJ's San Bruno is only good for their beer and TV's.

And though I haven't seen it, I'm sure she carries a machete, chainsaw, and some Rocky and Bullwinkle bombs in her purse. So when she says she likes coming here, I'm not going to disagree with her. At least, not to her face. We used to work together, and are here to catch up. She orders beer, and I order an ahi tuna appetizer, and spicy buffalo wings. I wanted to order the rootbeer float, but when I ask the waiter how much the rootbeer float would be as opposed to a regular rootbeer he says he doesn't know.   And since he took away our menus awhile ago, and since I don't want a rootbeer float that badly, I'm not going to fight with him.  But when she starts asking him about what kind of vodka they have at the bar, and if he can make this or that drink, and he says ""I don't know,"" I began to shake my head. I hoped he would see it. It was my way of warning him that he better run and get those drinks she wanted, and quick too.  You don't want to get on her bad side, I tried to convey to him telepathically, as I looked at him, and back at the bar. Hinting that that's where he should be. Not here, answering ""I don't know"" to what drinks they can and can't do. Fortunately, he lived to bring out my appetizers, the tuna had no flavor, and the buffalo wings tasted like Tabasco sauce.

I am not familiar with this menu, and on the first page of beers it shows one stout. I figured you guys only offered one stout so I ordered ""one stout please."" It wasn't the one I thought I was getting. My server should have specified which stout I wanted... Unless she is just new? She should ask what kind especially for beers, or any kind of alcohol that has different flavors with its (example, beer) family. To me, this problem is the same as me ordering ""one beer please""... Obviously the waiter/bartender would respond, ""which kind?"" Also, I know I could have approached my server to solve this solution but it wasn't until I got my bill that I realized the stout situation.

Food was subpar, but the server would never know since we barely saw him. It was the worst service I've ever had. I've never contemplated leaving no tip before last night, but I couldn't do that. I was under the impression that if you were a bar server, you had to be a phenomenal employee? We were never checked in, never got refills for drinks, and still spent $57. Unreal.

I was standing in front and actually have fallen in line by the take out service area and I agree, I should have looked closely around and read whatever was written but I didn't. But then I patiently stood there until 2 of the people in front of me were done. I still patiently stood while the manager was speaking with one of the staff manning  the area. There was another staff on that same spot that wasn't saying anything and was just giving me side glances until I finally deicided to approach to ask if that is were I need to ask for seating. She pointed me to the direction of the one on the right side which clearly I didn't notice. It was btw so close by my right side while I was patiently waiting in line. I've been to other restaurants and bj's brewery restaurant in the Bay Area and the minute I walked in and stood there looking unsure, some staff will always approach to ask if I needed help. The bottom line, poor customer service and considering there were staffs available milling around while I was standing, no one bothered to ask while I try to give each and every one that look of someone needing assistance.

Tim B.,"Novato, CA",70,278,8,4.0,3/4/2015,"So, after our wonderful excursion to Cambria we drove up Highway 1 to Carmel, then battled obnoxious traffic coming into Santa Cruz. At first I'd contemplating continuing following the coast to check out the newly constructed Devil's Slide tunnel just south of Pacifica. But the Big Sur experience had tested our patience - it being Presidents' Day, there was more than the normal share of touristy drivers - you know the type, not staying at any consistent speed. Or direction. Because of that we elected to travel Highway 17 to Los Gatos, then 85 to Mountain View where it intersects with Interstate 280, and then travelled up the Peninsula until we reached South San Francisco and got off at ""Interstate"" 380, all 2  1/2 miles of it. That proved too long as we exited that freeway at El Camino Real and thrust our car towards the legendary Tanforan Park. Back in the day Tanforan served as the quintessential aging 1950's/1960's mall, and by the early aughts it was playing that role in an unfortunate way, as tenants were deserting the shopping centers like Bill Cosby supporters. The powers that be decided that a renovation was in order, and by the time I returned in 2006 after a five year absence, I barely recognized the place. One can argue about the goods and evils of renovating the center, but I do think the addition of BJ's was a boon - before all the shopping center offered was food courts and a few forgettable cafes. Our 2006 trip to this location was the first BJ experience we had (insert juvenile joke here), although in the meantime we have also perused the Sacramento and San Rafael locations. This time, we arrived at about 2:30 - I was thinking it'd be rather quiet, but it was about 90% full. In spite of that, our service was prompt and professional. We each ordered from the light menu, and were satisfied for most of the rest of the day. Buffalo Bison Burger, baby! I guess my only criticism of this location is that I wouldn't be able to distinguish it from the other franchises - maybe there was something to highlight the fact that it was in South San Francisco as opposed to Sacramento, but I missed it.  And, you'd think that something with the word ""Brewhouse"" in its name would, you know, brew its own beer.

It was a forced, ""I hate my job"" kind of greeting. From the start I knew it was going to be a bad experience. 3) We had to ask our server for everything, including plates for our appetizer, for which she looked bothered when asked. 4) THERE WAS AN ANT ON MY PLATE. And the server didn't even bother to apologize. Honestly, I always tip regardless of terrible service...but this was just overwhelmingly bad.

My go to appetizers would have to be spinach artichoke dip with chips, avocado spring rolls, calamari, and the bruschetta. My go to salad, is the crispy honey chicken, it's so deliciously good! (If I want to be on the healthier side haha) And go to entrees would be the chicken alfredo(sometimes it's done nicely, and sometimes it can be bland). Pizzaaaaaas are always deep dish! Because it's delish! Went with the bj's favorite, which consists of onions, olives, bell peppers, mushrooms, tomato, pepperoni, and sausages. It's so good and I normally dislike pizza, but when it's gourmet and deep dish.. I can't say no.  Can't forget about the dessert! ALWAYS, pizzokie.

Last year we came here quite often and never had any issues, in fact we used to quite enjoy it. However we both agree the service and food at this location have gone downhill significantly in recent months. To sum up today's lunch  experience: - slow, careless, rude service - flat, stale tasting beer - food so terrible we could barely eat any of our appetizer or entree I noticed we weren't the only guests that were frustrated & unsatisfied. If this place wasn't in such a highly-trafficked location, it would have no chance at surviving.

Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",124,506,,2.0,1/1/2016,Lukewarm avocado egg roll appetizer that was probably placed in the microwave before being brought to the table.  Lukewarm pizza supposedly straight from the oven. How can the pan be hot yet the cheese on the pizza is barely melted? All the toppings would fall off each time a slice was taken from the pan.  The only thing that was at the correct temperature was my wedge salad. -__- I've been here many times and I don't remember the food ever being this bad.

Well basically, my girlfriend and I used to come here on a pretty regular basses even though every time we come, the service is literally the worst! Management I really hope you are reading this because I am sitting here right now, 20 minutes after being sat, our waiter still has not greeted us. This happens every time we come here. I go to a lot of BJs in the South Bay and never have this problem. The wait staff is rude, don't know the menu, ignore you when you are trying to get their attention, and this is the best one. Countless times when we want to order and our waiter is no where to be found and we ask the hostess to get our waiter or waitress, we ALWAYS get an eye roll. We stopped coming here because of the completely awful service even through the food is good. I hope you read this review to your staff at line up as I too were in the industry for awhile in order to put them in check or something.

Discourser T.,"Daly City, CA",1,32,,1.0,10/25/2015,"My wife and I stopped to grab an early dinner on October 25. After a brief wait, we were seated in the back room. Our server appeared and said he would be with us in a few minutes. No big deal since we were both looking at the menu. He came back about five minutes later saying he was going to check on our drinks. I looked up at an obviously ""high"" employee and informed him we hadn't ordered anything. He mumbled something and left, returning a few minutes later with napkins for drinks.  We ordered two waters and an iced tea. Since we were ready to order our meal we went ahead. We ordered tomato bisque in a bread bowl, an arugula beet salad, a flat bread pizza, and Mediterranean chicken tacos.  Five minutes later an expediter arrived with a bowl of tomato bisque and a visibly dirty spoon. A second expediter arrived in the heels of the first with our salad.  I was slightly irritated that our order was wrong. Mind you, I had heard the three surrounding tables complain that their orders were wrong as well. The manager had already come over to smooth over issues at one table. My wife could not get our server's attention and went to the bar to get an employee.  The employee tracked down the manager who never was able to find our table. In the meantime, our ""high"" server made it to our table where I explained what we had ordered, requested it be filled correctly, and to bring clean silverware.  By that time we were both frustrated with the lack of ability to take and fulfill an order, being waited on by a clearly intoxicated employee, and the failure of the manager to come to our table after being requested not once but twice by the same employee. We left our table and informed the host stand of why we were leaving. Not so much as effort to get the manager. It would appear this is a regular occurrence.  This BJ's has been a toilet for some time and I will never step foot in this one again.

Elaine Y.,"San Francisco, CA",456,860,1388,3.0,7/1/2013,"BJ's has a very large menu (upwards of 15 pages) and serves a real hodgepod of items ranging from Asian fusion entrees to more traditional surf & turf dishes. Many of the dishes are calorie-heavy, so watch out.  I've come here multiple times and some of my choices were real hits while others were just mediocre. This particular time, I ordered a bison burger and subbed the coleslaw for a watermelon arugula salad.  My salad did not have arugula...it was a spring mix of spinach and red leaf lettuce topped with cubed watermelon and feta cheese. I found the mix very tasty. As for my burger, I ordered it medium, but it was definitely overcooked and almost tough to eat. I tried a bit of my mom's thai chicken mango salad. That was delicious. It had mangoes, avocado, sesame seeds, and a mix of bell peppers. Yum. I also tried a little bite of my dad's pulled pork sandwich. It was swimming in BBQ sauce, not really my thing. My brother had the chicken fried steak...it was a HUGE plate. It also definitely looked like a piece of steak compared to other places that serve it as a deep fried hamburger. It came with 2 large pieces served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of steamed zucchini and cauliflower.

He said that he is making a brand new one himself and that he did not want to send something unacceptable out. Wow! We were impressed. He said they would offer us a discount for the delay.

Elle C.,"Milpitas, CA",37,37,8,1.0,5/31/2016,"My daughter had a show nearby last December and we wanted to celebrate with our family that drove out to see her. BJ's closes late and can fit a large amount of people so we decided to come here. Biggest mistake! By their wait staff's behavior they obviously dislike each other and hate their jobs. We arrived at 9pm and got seated closer to 11pm. They kept saying 20 minutes, 20 minutes. If they just told the truth we could have gone somewhere else. A few of my family members that drove 1 1/2 hours had to leave before we were seated because it was getting so late.  We finally get seated and placed our drink order and waited 15 minutes for that. When our waitress came to take our food order another waitress came by and said she was slow and she can help but our waitress was salty and told her to bounce. We waited another 45 minutes before our food finally came out. She rarely came to our table to check on us but she was very attentive to a table across from us. While we waited for our drinks to be refilled a male waiter was passing by and my son said ""excuse me"" to get someone's attention. That male waiter kept walking and said ""I don't work here"" but entered the kitchen. Ew. We finally got the attention of another male waiter who started checking on us because our chic wasn't. He got our dessert order but got it wrong and we waited another 30 minutes for that and then another 30 minutes for our bill. We were frustrated with waiting and for being ignored we were complaining to each other about the horrible service. The male waiter that supposedly didn't work there and another one were sitting at a booth nearby giving us nasty looks for complaining. By the time we left it was almost 1am. Never ever again.

I was a little irritated though because they got my pizookie order wrong... And I was really excited for the one I got haha (that seems bratty.. oh well). We ordered: Avocado eggrolls: my favorite!! I love them both here and at the Cheesecake Factory. They give you 3 big eggrolls and they are cut in half, so you can definitely share! They come with a sweet tamarind sauce that goes really well with the avocado. Hawaiian mahi mahi: Pretty disappointed in this dish. I think I paid $15 for it and the fish portion definitely did not look like it was worth $15!!! Maybe like... $7 lol. And that's being generous! The fish was also pretty dry and I didn't taste the soy glaze that it said it came with. However, the pineapple fried rice that came with this was delicious and made up for the lack of taste in the fish! Chicken bacon ranch pizza: Cute personal sized pizza. Didn't really taste the ranch so I wish it came with extra ranch for dipping hahaha Choc chip pizookie: Pretty standard, very delicious and soft even after we took it for takeout. We ended up putting it in the toaster oven to heat up and it was perfect! Still had crunchy edges and a soft inside. It was smart of them to give a separate container for the ice cream too. Only downside of this was that I actually ordered cookies and cream!!!!!!! :( Was so disappointed when we saw that it was chocolate chip.... Sigh.... Prob won't get over it until I actually get my cookies and cream pizookie lol. Only 3 stars because I was really disappointed with the fish for that price. All the other food deserves 4 stars!

I returned it and in about 5 minutes they brought my order back with the exact same shrimp, now cold, with a little cajun spice sprinkled on top. Still not blackened. Server agreed it wasn't right and offered to refire. I asked that he send the manager over. She apologized, said it would be free and offered dessert for the people eating with me since they'd be finished by the time I got my food. (Table got a tasty pazookie and a scoop of ice cream.) 20 minutes later, I got shrimp cooked without seasoning and then rolled in way too much seasoning. Very salty. Still not blackened. Everyone else was done and I gave up. Another 10 minutes or so to get a manager over (different than first). She apologized and offered me something else to eat, but by this time everyone was ready to leave. She asked what she could do for me and suggested perhaps a gift card. She sent me away with a $25 gift card, but I'm not particularly anxious to come back, especially after this experience (and seeing their 2.5 star rating here.) Tip to BJ's: Rather than just compensating an unhappy customer, alert the kitchen that's about to refire a poorly prepared meal to put a rush on it and to make sure it's what it's supposed to be. Also, have your chefs see  In addition to the above, my wife's bison burger was not cooked rare as requested.

However, today was not a good day for them. I placed a to go lunch order online at 11:30am and indicated a 12:15pm pick up. I got the BBQ pork sandwich with a side salad. I figured 45 minutes would be enough for one sandwich. WRONG! I got there at 12:10 and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes, because there were several large orders ahead of mine. I did not leave BJ's with food in hand until 12:55. It took them AN HOUR AND A HALF to cook my one sandwich and a small salad. There were two groups of people ahead of me and each bad 10-15 entrees PER group. So I had to wait while 20-30 entrees were prepped ahead of my ONE sandwich.  While I absolutely understand the importance of making orders as they come in, this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. One sandwich should not have taken an hour and a half to get to a guest. I waited to arrive to pick up my food for 45 minutes, and then I waited another 45 minutes in the restaurant. Not cool. The only plus is that the employee at the take out counter was friendly and kept apologizing and volunteering to go check on my food for me. I will not do a to go order again here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=400

Thomas W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/20/2016,"For my first experience at a BJ's restaurant, I could not have asked for a better experience. I went in with an open mind, unlike most first time customers in restaurants these days; however from the moment I sat down until the moment it was time to leave... my expectations could have never been more inaccurate.  For me, it's all about the service. I'm a people person, who hates people. Weird right? But like anyone out there, I create a great relationship with someone who shows interest in me and my friends and provides an environment that I feel as comfortable as eating at home in my own living room.  My server Chaz, was more than I could ever ask for. I felt as if he was my best friend from the moment we sat down, receiving an oddly-familiar welcome from a very unfamiliar friend... and I use the term friend loosely because regardless that I had never met him before he left such an impression that I felt inclined to invite him out for a glass of wine with my group after he got off work.  He was unusually personable, in a great way, and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had at a casual dining restaurant in this area. Bottom Line/TLDR: Go to BJ's in San Bruno and ask for Chaz, and whether you are expecting a fun dining experience or not, you'll definitely get one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=400

Overall, it was one good FIFA Final experience and kudos to Keith for the good service provided.  I am glad that the crowd wasn't overly rowdy or obnoxious as people could get emotional cheering and rooting for their favorite team to bring home the trophy.  :)  It is a fun sports bar and restaurant to watch a game.  One tip: Get there at least an hour EARLIER to secure better seating for big events like World Series, Super Bowl, etc.  :P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=400

This place is basically like Elephant bar. Its family friendly, and its adult friendly, since there's a bar there also. The lighting here has always been dim, so be orepared to squint while reading the menu. The menu varies from pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches, to seafood, light food, and desserts. This place also has several ""customize yourself"" items. When this place first opened up, it really was something big. Over the years, their quality of food sorta went down in a slow descent. They added the ""small snacks"" portion, but some of these snacks do not fit the description of ""small snack"". They've also increased the prices for many of their entrees, but the portions are always smaller than the price you pay for. Some recent additions that have been made are the additional tables outside the restaurant and inside the mall. More seats = more people accommodated = better business. Service here is amazingly slow. I understand that it gets way busy on weekends, but sometimes people who come here after you will end up getting their food before you. Some waiters here work well, while others don't. There was an instance where my family and I had waited about 30-40 mins for our food, and when they brought it to our table, they just slid the plates across the table rather than gently pass them to us. They didn't even have the nerve to apologize, they just walked off afterwards. I get that people have off days, but you chose to work at a restaurant that gets busy. If you can't work well under pressure, then throw in the towel and get another job. Some foods here are definitely not worth the price. Back then, their presentation of foods were on point. But over the years, that has changed. Their pastas sound so good through the description, but when they come out, they look like something anyone can cook within their own homes. I'm not down to pay $15 just to eat pasta that looks like it was splashed in sauce and dumped on the plate. Recently, I waited for a California chicken sandwich and when it came out, it was just a basic sandwich with fries. Did I really just wait 30 minutes for a simple sandwich that I could've made myself?  That and the chicken was burnt also, it tasted like charcoal.

Honesty, all the food we ordered was great.  They have a plethora of enticing appetizers.  So we did it tapas style and feasted with a menu on the side in case we were hungry for more.   The Thai shrimp wraps were about as Thai as the lemongrass included but really scrumptious all wrapped in butter lettuce with a sweet soy sauce to dip in. The stuffed mushrooms...  We inhaled them! The Santa Fe spring rolls were filled with chicken, black bean, red peppers and other fresh ingredients resulting in nuances of flavors.  They also came with two delectable dipping sauces.  That avocado one and some sort of spicy aoli were so good, we were dipping the fried artichoke hearts in there too. All this was not enough, so the bf ordered a cup of chili and me the minestrone.  What a way to end a fun meal.  The chili was robust and flavorful.  My minestrone totally exceeded my expectations with the loaded vegetables, kidney beans and some fusilli.  It came with some parmesan to sprinkle on top too. This place is super big and lofty.  It has a fun atmosphere with tons of TV's, festive beer motifs and some ornate accessories like fancy mirrors and chandeliers.  The murals on the wall are great too.   This was our first time at this location, but our server was great.  I wish I knew his name, but he was an older bald Asian guy with glasses.  -very attentive, personable and solicitious.  He got me to sign up for a rewards card and explained the point system.  All this great service and knowledge with a joking personality to go with!  You bet we'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=420

Drinks also came, we'll 6 did the 7th took about 15 minutes. Meals came 5 and of 7 INCORRECT, Asked for no mayo, my burger came fully loaded with mayo. My mother asked for extra mayo and wedge fries, hers came with no mayo and skinny fries. Both of those are manageable, so we ate with no complaints. My 2 young daughters had kids meals, one with chicken  strips and apple sauce, of course they bring it with fries and no applesauce so my toddler had a meltdown. They finally bring her applesauce but NO SPOON, we asked 3 different people for spoons, another 15 minutes with NO spoon. Another meltdown. My other daughter ordered the kids cheeseburgers, they come and NO LIE, the burgers were about the size of a half dollar (one bite) and the bun was trippen the sz, we all laughed about it but the server or manager did nothing about it.  Last but not least was my teenager ordered a turkey club with no sauce, garlic, mayo or ranch. She hates sauces/condiments of course it comes with all the white gooey garlic/mayo sauce dripping from it, she wanted to puke. We told the server which of course they had to make another one. By the time it came, 15 minutes later, everyone was done and wanted to get the hell outta there she took a few bites but was no longer hungry. You would think they would compensate something but nope nothing, our server didnt even care about all the screwups..we spent over $125 for Shitty service, and mediocre food.

Kimberly E.,"Hercules, CA",985,175,494,1.0,1/1/2015,"Very, very disappointed about the service AND the food tonight. My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner here after a New Years Day adventure. And wow... I don't even know where to start.  First off, we found an open table at the bar area, so we sat down and waited for someone to serve us. Not long after, someone came up to us, cleared the table and asked us if we would like anything to drink. We ordered two beers, she checked our IDs, and then left us a menu. Just one. And by the time she came back to give us another, we were already set with what we wanted to order.  For appetizer, we ordered the the deep fried artichoke hearts. For entree, my boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and I ordered the soup and salad combo (I picked clam chowder and a house salad with vinaigrette on the side).  First thing that came to our table was my boyfriend's pasta and my clam chowder. The moment the soup touched my lips, I knew it was not the right temperature. I mixed it and tried to see if it was just the surface that was cold, but my second spoonful clarified that the soup was in fact lukewarm.  When the next food-runner came and brought us our appetizer (yes, our appetizer came after our entrees), I sent my soup back to be warmed. Keep in mind that I ordered a soup and salad combo and my salad still hasn't shown up.  Since my boyfriend's pasta was fine, he was pleased. I decided to try the deep fried artichokes. And let me just say... everything in that dish was sour. The artichokes were sour. The dipping sauce it came with was sour. The lemon they garnished the plate with was sour (hahahaha). I ended up asking my waiter for ranch, because it was overbearing.  When my warm soup finally came back out, my salad joined in and by that time, I was already losing my appetite. I did take a few more spoonfuls of the soup and a few bites of my salad. But after that, I gave up.  Overall, I don't expect much from chain restaurants.

Service is always slow whether or not you're in a big party. The only reason why I still come here is because their food is consistent. For the past 5+ years, I've always ordered the same thing: Parmesan crusted chicken, avocado egg rolls, and their brownie before they stopped making it. Prices and menus have changed over the years but these dishes remain constant.  Recently I decided to finally try something new, so I ordered their deep dish ravioli. It tasted like a gourmet Hot Pocket but expensive. Not worth it.  I like the concept of their rewards program but last I checked, you couldn't give them your phone number and you had to bring your rewards card with you every time.

Ordered soup and entree salad -- only problem was that salad came out first -- pretty quick, which I appreciate, but the cup of soup should have been first and I had to WAIT on that.   To me, kitchen's fault more than server's.  When I finally got the soup, it was lukewarm.   I told server not to remake, just nuke.  Got the soup and it was good. Then tackled the Asian Chopped Salad, which had been sitting on the table all this time and although great ingredients, it was pretty uninspired.  It just had no kick to it like other salads of this kind, and the chicken was just OK, like it had been sitting around all day and was thrown in the salad, not fresh.  And that's the thing -- the whole salad was missing freshness. I really think you guys (BJs mgmt) need to take another look at how things are prepared in the kitchen, how incoming orders are processed, etc.  I don't see the problem as much being the servers and everyone in front of house, who are all working their butts off, as much as those in the kitchen and back of house -- maybe they don't have enough support?

My last experience here started off really well. My family and I started off with the avocado egg rolls and clam chowder in a bread bowl. The avocado egg rolls are always a must for me because I love avocados and these are just deep fried rolls of creamy and cheesy goodness. The clam chowder was also really good. The bread bowl was crisp and light, with the perfect chewy texture.  After our appetizers, it didn't take long before our main entrees came to the table.

Though this isn't really actual deep dish pizza, I still like the pizza here. Happy hour does start at weird times though, it's more like happy late hour for me because I usually can only go to the one that starts late at 10p.  The menu is pretty big but we'll usually get some combination of the following, all of which I'd recommend: crisp potato skins platter, calamari, BJ's classic combo pizza, and the Great White pizza. I've also gotten the Twisted BLT salad, which comes with spinach. Actually, that salad makes me feel a little less guilty about eating at BJ's late at night because I'll have it with a few slices of pizza.

Cherylynn N.,"San Francisco, CA",4768,1994,8320,3.0,8/3/2015,"Women (preggo or not) have the weirdest cravings.  Mr. NSS: ""Where do you wanna eat?"" Me: ""I want BJs."" Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh, you forreals?"" Me:  ""Yah."" Mr. NSS: ""I never knew you had 8====D envy."" Me: ""Who wouldn't be jealous of mandingo?"" Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh, is there something you want to tell me?"" Me: ""Geez, relax...I want to eat at BJs."" I'm not a fan of chains and I will never understand WHY people would wait up to 2 hours to eat at BJs, or any chain for that matter. But I have to admit, sometimes I need a little avocado egg rolls, cheap liquor, and pizookie (freshly baked cookie topped w/ ice cream) in my life.  We came here for their Happy Hour Specials that run Monday - Friday from 3 pm - 7 pm, and Sunday - Thursday from 10 pm - close: *$1 off guest beers *$4 craft beers *$5 mojitos, martinis & wine *$6 for slightly higher tier wine *$4-$6 apps: chicken wings, flatbread, spinach dip, sliders, potstickers, avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and mini deep dish pizza (reduced HH portions so you're not saving that much in hindsight) I've visited BJ's more times than my check-ins indicate because my family like chains. I don't like waiting for a table so we usually try to snatch a table in the bar area since it's open seating. On our last visit, we sat in their outdoor patio and brought Tater Tot along:  .  As with any chain restaurant, I always come in with very low expectations. The safest bet on BJ's menu are their apps and pizzas. On our latest visit, we ordered their Avocado Rolls (HH - $6) to start:  . They tasted really off this time. It was sour like the cooks added too much citrus to keep the avocados from oxidizing. After downing two of my very stiff $4 Tanquerey gin & tonics (no top shelf gin), I didn't mind so much.  I wasn't feeling pizza so I ordered the Sante Fe Salad ($13.50):    which was piled high with crisp romaine lettuce, onions, red bell peppers, chicken cubes, cheese, and crunchy tortilla strips. The salad was lightly tossed in a semi-creamy dressing. Pretty decent and much better than the Sante Fe Salad I had the next day at nearby Nueve (Bayhill Shopping Plaza). Mr. NSS ordered the Ribeye ($23) which was awful! I told him that's not one of the items that you should order at BJs but hey, the man wanted steak. It was a cheap cut of meat with zero marbling. It was definitely not a ribeye steak but a sirloin or top round that was slapped onto a Forman Grill type of cooking device. There was grill marks but the rest of the steak looked so rubbery. He asked for rare, it came out medium well so he had to send it back. The second one was cooked better but it was just horrible quality; very tough, dry, and chewy. I had better steak at Sizzler's. Management, please take note: either you're scamming customers or your meat supplier is scamming you. Your ribeyes are not ribeyes, as another Yelper also seemed to have the same issue.  Anyhow, there was no room for a pizookie since we indulged in a second round of avocado rolls, even though they weren't that great to begin with. Dayam you, Mr. Tanquerey! Food has always been what it is for a chain: glorified frozen food but we've never had issues with any of the servers who are nice and efficient. We had the same server twice in a row and he was really nice to Tater Tot. He said, his ex-gf had a pom and that he missed him. He even showed us a pic.

I called ahead on a Friday night for a party of 5 and when I arrived they said it would take about 30 min. I'm not sure how long it would have took if I didn't call ahead and it looked like there were a lot of people waiting for a table. My family and I just browsed around the bookstore before our table was ready so there were no problems there. We were seated in their confusing 'patio' area which is pretty much part of the mall area. Though it was quieter then being seated inside, we barely saw our server throughout our dinner experience. When we were first seated by the host, it looked like someone spilled their drink or something and so the booth seating was wet so I asked if we could sit at a different booth. The host obliged but, they didn't do anything to fix the wet seat booth that we moved from. They sat a different party there and they said the same thing that the seat was wet and all they offered them was a napkin to place on the wet area.  Anyways, for appetizers we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the cheesy fries to start. The appetizers came pretty quickly but we didnt have any utensils or plates. I asked the server and he said ok.....never did it....I asked again, and we finally got utensils, but by this time we finished the apps and had the greasy fingers to prove it. For an entree we shared a large pizza and it was fine. Standard pizza with a pretty good deep dish crust. Overall the experience was meh...

Kim L.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"It saddens me to write this review as I have been a loyal BJs guest for years.  Service has always been an issue at this BJ's (front desk greeters always seem too distracted by their phones or talking to each other to greet, waiters are moving too quick to listen to your order, food comes out slow, etc), but this experience was BY FAR the most disappointing I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I had just come out of seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi on a complete high.  We were pumped from the movie and ready to discuss more over some yummy food and potentially, a pizookie! We walked in, gave our name, and the greeter said ""Ok about 30-45 minutes."" Not a problem at all - a wait was to be expected on a Saturday night during primetime.  (not to mention we signed in and put our name using our BJ's Loyalty phone #).  About 30 minutes had passed by and we were starting to get antsy, anxiously awaiting the text message that our table was ready....45 minutes passed...still no text.  I, very nicely, walk up to the front desk guy to ask him if there was an update on our table.  The two guys at the counter looked confused when I said my name and that I have not received a text yet.  They said ""Ok - we will get you seated as soon as possible. It's going to be a minute or so.""  First of all, I've seen multiple parties of 2 come in and give their name and get seated on the spot, which was weird since we had been waiting nearly an hour.  Secondly, I've already been waiting longer than the original given time so ""a minute or so"" doesn't really give me any hope.  I sit down, annoyed but still understanding, since they seemed swamped.  An hour+ goes by and I see the couple that walked in right in front of us get seated, then more groups of 2. ...Finally about an hour and 20 minutes later, we finally get seated....we get walked to our table by a very nice lady, she seats us, we decide what we want to order, and we give the sign that we are ready (close our menus).  A waiter takes the order from the table right next to us and walks right by our table..not even saying ""hello"" or ""I'll be right with you"".  2-3 more minutes pass and we are still sitting there with waiters walking passed us like we were invisible.  After nearly 20 minutes of sitting at our table with NOBODY asking us how we were doing or even getting us water, we are too frustrated and decide to leave.  Not ONE PERSON said anything to us as we got up and left our table...I walked up to the front guy and shared with him how long we had been sitting there, with no one asking us how we were doing, my frustrations, etc.  I wish i could have spoken to a manager because, although it was not this guy's fault, he couldn't have cared any less that he was losing 2 guests who would have paid $50+ for dinner + dessert.   I love coming to BJ's for a good, well-priced meal but after this past Saturday's experience, I am going to have to reconsider coming back here for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=100

It's not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but this place is consistently overcrowded. Wait times in any time approaching dinner are out of this world, and we have frequently left after discovering it would take over an hour and a half to seat two diners. Since the service is generally slow, it's not too surprising that they cannot open up tables more quickly. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations, either, so there is little chance to get ahead of the rush. I tried the ""priority waitlist"" option they now offer throught the BJs app, and they did not grant us any priority, and one host acknowledged they had forgotten our names had even been put in.

Alex B.,"Oyster Point, CA",47,24,,2.0,5/12/2017,"I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes, it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar, I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes, but of course, there are shining exceptions.  The food is decent for the most part, with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times, and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard, but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas. While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller, contrarily, entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much, but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable. Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food, but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=100

Joy W.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",187,441,2629,3.0,3/5/2016,"BJ's is on par with all the other chain restaurants. So, I don't see why people would wait an hour for a table at BJ's, except maybe because it's one of the only sit-down restaurants with waiter service in the Tanforan mall. *To reduce the wait time, you can  1. Call ahead to be put on the waitlist.  2. Now, you can also download their mobile app and use the Preferred Waitlist function.  3. You can even place your order for dining in on their website. 4. The bar area is open seating.* They try to cater to very different demographics. I get it, they're trying to capture as much market demand as the area has to offer. It's half a sports bar and half a family restaurant, which makes it rather confusing and not very optimal for either dining group. Sometimes you sit next to a tipsy frat boy, sometimes next to a screaming baby. Sometimes, you're within earshot of both. I'm just kidding...sort of. I've never been a fan because BJ's doesn't have many distinguishing signature dishes that sets it apart from other casual dining establishments. Wait, there are the Avocado Egg Rolls & Pizzookies...meh. Oh, and a decent beer selection. Avocado Egg Rolls - avocados, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, chipotle peppers & spices, with sweet tamarind sauce: Pretty good idea taking something good and fatty, wrapping it in spring roll wrappers and frying them. Crunchy & creamy, sweet and a just a little bit spicy.  Not bad, but I can't stomach too many, because they're so oily and heavy. After a couple of these, they just feel like a lot of mush in my mouth. One too many and it would make me a little nauseous. As for the Pizzookie - the beloved pizza/cookie (cookie large enough to share) topped with ice cream. Frankly, I prefer cookies that are already individual-sized so I wouldn't need the use of a knife and fork. Yes it's good. Cookies and ice cream tasting good is like telling me the sky is blue. It's also a fine example of taking something that already exists and giving it a catchy name. Good marketing, but not exactly a novel idea. That's a little harsh. They do come in different flavors, after all. For more of a substantial meal, I usually get a burger. Burgers are always a fail-safe option in diners. The beef is usually cooked nearly well done, but they're meaty and filling, and that's all that matters. The pizzas are not bad. Although, the deep dish pizzas really shouldn't be called 'deep-dish.' It's more like thick doughy bread with some cheesy toppings. Ever since the FDA required chain restaurants to include nutritional info on their menus, I admit it somewhat influenced my decisions...briefly. I tried a salad, which I rarely do, because I usually prefer to make my own salad than pay a high mark-up for a dressed up pile of lettuce. But it turned out to be a pretty good salad. Santa Fe Salad - romaine, blackened chicken breast, red peppers, jack and cheddar, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes and corn tortilla strips w/ Santa Fe dressing: I chose the Santa Fe, because I like crunchy tortilla strips in my salads. They're like less-dense croutons with the same satisfying crunch. The dressing was creamy, but not heavy. Chicken was seasoned well. The ingredients tasted fresh and crisp. Chicken Wings drizzled w/ buffalo & ranch sauces are A-okay.  We once received some raw chicken though. To be fair, it was only raw in the center. I understand mistakes happen, but they should have frying chicken down to a science. We told our waiter about the raw chicken and he was apologetic, super polite and friendly. They comped our chicken and brought out our second plate of cooked chicken. In my opinion, I kind of thought our meal should have been comped. Raw poultry is not to be taken lightly. Overall, the menu is, in a word, boring. That is to be expected, because it is still meant to cater to the masses. Still, I never find myself WANTING to visit BJ's. It's just an okay option if you're hungry after watching a movie. Mr. Joy likes this place for their happy hour deals, but after the raw chicken incident, I finally told him I have no interest in returning BJ's again. Raw food or not, there's really nothing at BJ's that I crave. On the plus side, I've always enjoyed the snakebites here.  Also, I've always found the service to be pretty damn good. I don't know if my server was gunning for a big tip, but he brought me a refill of my drink before I even took a sip of my first one.  Another time, I stupidly left my cell phone in one of the booths once. I came back all worried and harebrained, but my waiter kept it safe for me.

When I arrived I was informed that the bar was open and that the floor seating was full. That was fine so my party and I decided to walk around and wait for a table to open up.  After shopping around at the near by Barnes and Nobles the timer went off and the table was ready. Upon returning to the restaurant my group and I were seated and handed menus. The menu is just as advertised. Lots of choices to choose from if you have a big appetite. If you like beer this place is for YOU!  There are several TVs here which is great because the NBA playoffs were on and that was a primary reason for stopping by to eat lunch. I wanted to at least watch till halftime before leaving but we left midway through the 2 quarter.  My issue with this place stemmed from the server. He was just not attentive or interested in serving anyone. The way in which he placed the plates on the table to serve us was nonchalantly. I mean, if you don't care about getting a tip or tipped well I get it. Or, maybe you just didn't feel like coming in today. I was not sure what the issue was but it was not necessary.  I will come back and give the bar a try next time. I have heard good reviews about the drinks and the bartenders.

Vee T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,I had just flown into town and was starving.... my husband and I came across this BJ restaurant because it was close to our hotel. We got seated right away and were greeted by a friendly server. My husband ordered a hamburger and I ordered a salad some brussels sprouts and an appetizer macaroni and cheese. The salad came out first and it was missing almost all of the ingredients that were supposed to be on it. The lettuce was wilted and it was a shameful salad. I sent it back and asked for a new one to be made. About 10 minutes later a new salad came out and it was still missing some ingredients! I asked for the missing ingredients on the side and ate the salad anyway as I was starving. In about another 10 or 15 all of the other food came out. The macaroni was hard around the edges and ice cold in the middle as were the brussels sprouts so I sent both of them back to be remade. About five minutes later the manager came to our table and told us how sorry he was and that our meal would be on the house. We were still waiting for our food to come back out at this point. It probably took another 15 to 20 minutes for the macaroni to come out and it actually tasted pretty good. I am still waiting for my brussels sprouts as I'm writing this and I'm already at my hotel LOL!! Something is very wrong with the kitchen staff in this place. The server and the manager were nice and tried to make it better.  Everything took way too long and tasted like crap so overall I would never go back and I do not recommend it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=100

Joe P.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/22/2016,"Came in for a quick lunch after running around in the mall.  My wife and I were seated pretty quickly since it was after lunchtime around 2pm.  The server took our order fairly quickly after serving us the water and lemonade we asked for as drinks.  My wife ordered the spaghetti and meat balls, and I the 'midnight burger'. As we waited for our food, a few minutes go by and we asked our server to add an appetizer, queso dip to our order.  No problem so far. We waited, and waited, and close to 30 minutes had gone by and no food, no queso either.  Then another person helping the server brings our food to the table.  No queso.  We asked about the appetizer, and the original server is asking us what we ordered?  We simply said no need for appetizer anylonger since food was here already. The seemed to have misplaced our appetizer order. The burger was still warm, but the spaghetti and meatballs were cold, so my wife asks the server to please reheat it.  The server takes the dish away.  Meanwhile, I am now eating by myself as my wife sitting across from me watches.  I eat slow waiting for the spaghetti to return.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Server comes by and says the dish will be brought out by the manager.  Waiting.  Waiting. Server finally brings the dish back, no manager.  My wife now begins to eat, meanwhile I am done and its my turn to watch her eat.  Shame, we were supposed to have lunch together.  Server says the manager will be by soon to chat with us.  Waited. And waited some more. Enough. Asked the server for check.  Paid the check and even tipped her (not as much as I would have otherwise).  On way out, the manager was by the door, I told him to read Yelp this afternoon about our experience.  The manager claimed he was not ware of this.   As we began to leave, on the way out, three servers by the door overhear my comment about Yelp.  One of them very pronouncedly began snipping and making remarks about Yelp, and making fun of both my wife and I. We quickly re-entered the restaurant and faced the person, whom quickly left toward the back.  We asked for the manager, and explained the treatment we as customers received by the servers representing BJ's.  I asked the manager to have the server come out and apologize to my wife.  To their credit, the manager and the server both apologized.   Its one thing to have mediocre service, and another to ridicule paying customers.  To the manager we wish best of luck.  To the disrespectful young server, we wish you well too.   We too were young once.   Hopefully we all learned something today...me, to rethink patronizing this BJ's ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=360

In what world is arugula kale? I was so shocked by his genuine response that I couldn't even argue with him. Somehow he genuinely convinced my friend that I ate with.  When he left I pulled out my phone to show my friend what kale actually looks like and what arugula looks like. Anyways maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of this than I should... But if I order a specific salad, I'm hoping to get what's on it. That wasn't really what made this a 2.  The pizza was really bland. It was their ""most popular"" combo one we ordered.

We did have a few mishaps during our lunch.  The first one was that the booth wasn't entirely wiped down and clean.  That was a bit awkward.  One side still had come crumbs and grease on the bench.  So we had to wait for them to get a rag to clean that off for us.   Once seated, we decided to order three pizzas: Gluten-free thin crust pizza; w/artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, and cilantro Hand-tossed pizza - BJ's Classic Combo (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms) Deep Dish pizza: Chicken Bacon Ranch (Grilled garlic chicken, Applewood smoked bacon, jack and cheddar cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes and a drizzle of ranch dressing. While waiting, we were brought our drinks and soon after our plates. The second mishap was that the plates they brought were still dirty.  It may have run through their dishwasher, but there were dried up cheese residue on a couple plates and specks of ""I don't know what"" on another.  The waiter promptly replaced them after I addressed it.  This time, the plates were perfectly clean and spotless.  We had a well-mannered and polite waiter. It wasn't too long a wait for all the pizzas.  Looked good, but I didn't hear any ""mmmms"" during the meal.  I was average at best....but not terrible.  The deep dish tasted more like a pan-style pizza and had some crispy edges similar to Pizza Hut.  That had good flavor. The hand-tossed was a bit disappointing though.  It was as plain as it gets and the crust was flat in both texture and taste.  It reminded me of carnival pizza.  I didn't try the gluten-free pizza (which was for my mother).  She said that it tasted fine, but they forgot the cilantro topping.  That was the third and last mishap. I did notify the waiter who offered to sprinkle it on, but I just asked him to take it off the bill which he did. The place itself had high ceilings, nice crowd, and lots of TV screens for World Cup coverage and the Giants game.  Also - nice that there's a B&N next door.

Mike L.,"San Francisco, CA",1140,1142,1765,3.0,10/18/2012,"Generally speaking, I try to avoid chain restaurants if/when I can.  It's not because I think their food is terrible (although it can be at a few places), but rather a preference to go somewhere unique...and likely better.  The two places I'd make the occasional exceptions for?  Cheesecake Factory and BJ's (insert dirty joke here). While I generally don't expect much from chain restaurants, the food at BJ's isn't too shabby (Cheesecake Factory is better though).  Granted, I've only tried a few things, but it' has been better than what little I've had from places like Chili's and TGI Friday's.  While taking in a Giants game after work, my friend and I decided to split an order of the Artichoke Dip appetizer and the BJ's Favorite Pizza (oven baked meatballs, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions, and roasted tomatoes). Compared to the Artichoke Dips I've tried at other chains, this one wasn't all that different ( ).  The dip was a little salty and rich, but I can't complain with the amount of cheese they threw in, nor the amount of chips they gave us.  As for their pizza, it's probably the best bet for something good ( ).  The dough was a little fluffy, but not overly so, and I liked the mix of ingredients (it's essentially a combination topping pizza).  Perhaps it was a little heavy on the tomatoes and salt, but no worse than some other pizza joints out there.  Really, no complaints. With a solid beer selection (both outside and house brews) to go with their decent food menu, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to making future trips back to BJ's (especially since Gordon Biersch is gone).  A beer, pizza, and a giant TV to watch whatever game is on?  Sounds good to me (especially if my team wins).  Too bad there always seems to be a long wait for a table though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=360

I will give credit where credit is due, the manager did come out and at least acknowledge that it was an unreasonable amount of time that we waited for our food. He offered us a Pizookie on the house, I countered with what I thought was a fair resolution and he obliged. The food was still decent, once it finally arrived. Saved them from a 1 star review. I won't ever return to this BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=360
Jackson L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,5,3,1.0,7/24/2015,"Vegetarian gets rash from Portobello Burger. Poor service overall As a vegetarian, I was very limited by my options. When I ordered the vegetarian-friendly Portobello Mushroom Burger, I bit into it and found a piece of beef patty in it. Immediately, I asked my waitress to check on my burger. I asked her, ""Is this beef? She confirmed it, and I told her that menu said the burger was vegetarian-friendly and only include mushrooms. She responded, ""No, it's not,"" and walked away without honoring my complaint.  I will not return to this restaurant.  If a vegetarian cannot order the only thing the menu that's vegetarian, then something is not right with the restaurant.

Dorothy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,33,1.0,12/8/2016,"I like BJs but not this one. I went out last night with my husband and friend. We ordered an appetizer plate, 2 burgers and battered mushrooms along with 3 drinks. The appetizer plate came out first and all of the fried items (chicken wings/mozzarella sticks) were cold. We ate the rest of the items in hope of teaching down our waiter but he was no where to be found.  A different server brought us our food but we didn't have any utensils. When I asked for then she brought paper napkins but no rolled utensils. I had to go ask a different server for the utensils before we were able to eat. The burgers were sub par. My husbands was good but my roommates bun was extremely dry and everything was super oily. The family behind us was complaining about their meal S well.  The server only came back to ask if we wanted more to drink and never asked us how our food was. When I asked for the check he gave us the wrong persons bill then came back to return ours. Normally I don't complain, maybe he was having a bad day, or maybe he has too many tables. But overall service from all wait staff wasn't good.  I got home and I felt sick. I ended up getting food poisoning and was throwing up violently throughout the rest of the night.  I don't recommend this location to even my worst enemy.

Charles R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,1,2.0,6/11/2017,"I have been wanting to do a review of this restaurant for quite some time now and even though it's been over a year since we last visited this place, here are my 2 reviews of both times my girlfriend and I went. 1)  This was from our November 12, 2015 visit:  On this day, I met my new future girlfriend for a 2nd date.  Even though it was late at night, we felt unwelcomed there.  Believe me when I say that this restaurant needs new management. Service was extremely slow. Sometimes, the servers don't show up for about 10-15 minutes and you're just sitting there waiting.  Yet, we were sitting at a table that made us visible to everyone.  After we ordered, our food came out warm, not hot. We only ordered appetizers.  The tv's are great, but the atmosphere is very bland. I also noticed too that the wait staff tend to hang around with one another, ignoring customers.  I actually saw one employee texting.  There was no evidence of management around to delegate authority, so the staff do what they please. It would be a great place to go to, if there was a manager there that would be more strict with the staff.   2)  On March 12th, 2016, my girlfriend and I went there again (last time was our 2nd date in November, 2015 (see above)), and it was the same story as before. When we walked in I approached the hostess counter and gave my name and for 2 people.  She said it would be about a 15 minute wait.  Well, after waiting at least 45 minutes, I went up to the hostess counter and asked them how much longer for a table (there were 3 tables open).  When the hostess asked me who I was, I told her and for 2 people.  She apologized as she said to me that they thought I was a party of 4. The other hostess couldn't distinguish between 2 and 4. I made it clear that we were a party of 2 and she put 4. Next, after finally getting to the table, we ordered drinks and ordered the Fried Calamari, Fish & Chips and the Deep Dish Baked Ziti.  When we got our food, it was lousy. Really poor quality.  The fried calamari was cold (we returned it and the 2nd order wasn't better), the fish and chips were so, so greasy, you can actually see the oil they deep fried it in shine off the fish and fries. And you can actually see the oil drip off into the wax paper. The Deep Dish Baked Ziti wasn't any better. I spoke with the Manager, and he agreed to remove the Calamari and I also told him about our past experience.  Now this manager was from Texas.  Why would you bring in a manager from Texas.  Was this location so bad that they had to bring him in?  Well, even with him there, it still was the same.  The only good thing was our waitress. She was very nice, professional and polite.   Overall, after our past and present experiences, I give that restaurant a Grade Rating D-.  The only reason as to why it is not a Grade rating F (Failure) was because of the drinks and the waitress.  As of today, we have not been back to that restaurant and I don't feel that we will be going back there anytime soon.  It's just not worth it.  I'm sorry, but that restaurant needs a major overhaul.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=160

First our appetizer was burnt to the extent that it has a bitter after taste. Told the server that this is not what I expected since I've ordered this in the past. He said Brussels sprouts are suppose to be bitter. I partially agree to it but a bitter after taste tho? Plus you can literally see burnt pieces?? Uhhmmm maybe not.  Second was our main course... it took 42mins for it to be served. I was staring at our server since The table next to us arrived after us but got their meal first mind you we had similar orders except for my deep dish ziti which all came out warm and not hot. Fries were missing. You can tell our dish has been sitting out for a while.  And to top this wonderful experience of we were still on our tables getting ready to leave he took the check book to check if we left a tip.

Eugene approached me and offered to order another dish, but I just said ""I have to go."" Another disappointment was the Parmesan Crusted chicken. It was too salty because of too much Parmesan; the broccoli wasn't steamed and the size of the chicken was smaller than the ones ordered to eat in.

The quality of food is also horrible.  Compared to the other BJ locations this one has probably been the worse location I have visited. I wanted to give it two stars and I've visited this location a few times, especially during football games and HH prices. But each time I went they always messed up on our orders, overcharged us and added plates to our bill. Also, many times our calamari would come out burnt and the portion would be less and less every time.  I would understand if the calamari was on the HH menu then yes, smaller HH portion but it wasn't.  All servers are pretty rude and careless to help other tables and even there own.  Takes awhile to flag your own server down too, and when you do expect to wait another 30-25mins for water, peppers and new silverware.

Also fine. At least she acknowledged us. Fortunately there was a couple of servers up by the host station, and one of them seated us. Our waiter came almost immediately, which was awesome. My problem starts after we actually placed our order. Because of a rainy day, my daughter and I decided to stick with the chicken tortilla soup. Great soup kind of day. Gave our order to our waiter and proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for two bowls of soup. When it arrived, the bowls had hardly any soup in it and what was there was barely Luke warm. Mine had one piece of chicken and one tortilla strip in it. My daughter at least got two chicken pieces in hers, but alas, no tortilla strips. It's really too bad because the tortilla soup is really good! I also had a cup of coffee, which no one ever came back to see if I wanted a warm up or another cup.

Robert F.,"Daly City, CA",1,5,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Went there for Sunday Brunch. There was no wait and our server arrived promptly. He politely took our drink orders and came back with our drinks and took our meal orders. That's when our good luck ran out.  My coffee arrived in a dirty cup and with a soup spoon. We got that resolved when our waiter finally brought the appetizer but were then left to enjoy it with our hands until the waiter swung by again to check on us and noticed that we had no utensils or napkin setup. This was also resolved with its attendant wait so that when the food arrived, we were ready to eat.  Unfortunately, while the food was just fine, my order was incomplete. This took more time to resolve.  We had earlier mentioned to our server that we would be ordering more food to go and when we added this to our order, the waiter took great care in making us believe that he was paying attention to get it right. Unfortunately, when the check came, it was incorrect. We got this additional problem resolved and decided to not protest the $3.25 charge for toast that I thought came with my meal. We're were treated to watching the folks at the table next to us arguing over their check with their waiter and wondered if there is a training issue here or a deliberate pattern.  We finished our meal and did not have to wait long for our takeout. We discovered that the $5.25 charge for Mac-n-cheese bought us about 7oz in a 16oz cup. The drink was $9.95 and the Bison Burger was un-satisfyingly small.  My final impression is that while the food is fine and the waiter personable & accommodating, the sheer number of issues that needed to be resolved, coupled with the cost, and wait all combine to put this place on my avoid list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=480

BJ's San Bruno: A series of unfortunate events: 1) 10 minutes before we had anyone come to our table and ask us for our drinks (11:40am on a Sunday) 2) Our server handing me 5 sets of utensils to distribute to the rest of our party instead of laying them on the table 3) Our ""deep dish pizza"" looking like DiGiorno's in depth and taste  4) Our server saying that that really is how they serve deep dish pizza and pointing at the pizza tray as if ""deep dish"" refers to 2-inch baking sheets and not type of pizza we should be expecting. (For the record, we've been to other BJ's locations that had true deep dish pizza, in baking accessories and in actual pizza.) 5) Another server admitting that there was something wrong with their fridge which is why the pizzas weren't coming exactly like they normally do, but doing nothing to improve the situation. 6) Our party looking for the manager and finding no one. 7) Overall douchiness of our server. Think Mendez from Orange Is The New Black.  We were really debating on whether or not to pull a LeSean McCoy and give a $0.20 tip. We didn't end up doing so, but I totally understand where he's coming from. 3 stars because the tomato bisque soup, french toast and spinach and artichoke dip were actually decent.

When the manager was told how we felt like our table has been neglected, he's simply said "" let me see what I can do about that"" then simply changed our waiter. No apology, or anything.  The second waiter tried to make up for the first one. He did ok, but our table is full of dirty dishes as I type this. Oh, we accidentally knocked over a half full glass off soda, none of the staff offered to help clean it up and didn't even offer us a towel. I had to ask for something to clean it up. Then when he (the first waiter) returned, he just dropped a stack of of small square napkins on the table and walked away.   If we weren't hear celebrating something, and NINE of us, we would have just left.....

She never pointed to anything, her hand was resting on the menu  She said the order would be expedited and it would be 5 minutes tops 15 or 20 minutes later as my food sat iced cold she said that shrimp took a long time which is why it couldn't be expedited.  It was sautéed shrimp 3 minutes on each side.

Venus L.,"San Bruno, CA",187,608,1205,1.0,6/30/2013,"After my visit to this BJ's, I came home sad and with a tummy ache.  I know that experiences at restaurants could be a hit or a miss depending on when you go and who you get as your server. In this case, I guess it was a HUGE miss.  First off, we had 7 people in our party so they sat us as one of the booths on the right side. Unfortunately, my dad is a pretty big person so one side sat 3 people and the other side sat 4. It was painful since we were pretty squished even with ""skinny girls"" and another guy. We weren't able to put a chair at the end of the table because that's considered a fire hazard which we totally understood. But it was just a painful dining experience.  Next issue? The pizza. We ordered a large BJ's favorite and there was barely any toppings on the pizza which led us to think that we had gotten the wrong pizza. (We didn't. Boo.) And the pizza crust seemed WAY thinner than usual. Seriously? It became our least favorite thing on the menu.  The rest of the food came out about 15-20 minutes after the pizza. And well, I'm not sure about the others but my grilled chicken pasta came out cold. Not even slightly warm. Just... cold. And the chicken was dry. Needless to say, I was bummed but choked down the meal with the help of my root beer. And service? Our waiter was not in tune with our needs. And most of the time we had to flag him down. Which was not cool, especially since we saw him ask the tables around us repeatedly if they need anything. We felt ignored.  So overall, eh. We agreed that it was gonna take A LOT for us to give this place another chance. I dunno. Maybe it was just a miss this time and next time it'll be a hit?

We ordered waters and told him we were all set to order. He said okay and then he left without taking our orders. Then 5 mins later another girl came and brought us water.

Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4220,3904,30025,3.0,1/17/2011,"I have to admit that the only reason I've ever come to BJ's is the convenience of its location en route to SFO. There is really nothing distinctive about the menu compared to a Chili's or a Hard Rock Cafe or an Applebee's, and the service is basically the same as those chains as well. What struck me about my visit there was the prominence of the calorie counts under each item, and the fact that they actually influenced my choice.  Y'see, I was on my way to the airport to start a 2 1/2-week holiday in Iberia and Morocco fully recognizing that I wasn't going to make nutrition a huge priority when I crossed the pond. In fact, I could have used a calorie count on the bowl of snails I ate at a random food stand in the expansive night market in Marrakesh. BJ's doesn't offer snails, but they make decent Fish Tacos. Panko-crusted and lightly fried fish served in corn tortillas with a chipotle mayonnaise, Santa Fe dressing, and shredded vegetables (see photo).  It was satisfying especially with some tortilla chips and a couple of dipping sauces - avocado cream sauce and fire-roasted tomato salsa. I added a side salad for good measure, dressing on the side of course (see photo). It was a perfectly acceptable pitstop on the way to the airport, and the timing was right since the baby brigade started rolling in as we were about to leave. I was particularly impressed with a young mother who tried to feed her two toddlers only to have one boy shrieking like a banshee and forcing her to abandon her plans of a quiet lunch. The snails don't seem so bad now, do they... FOOD - 3 stars...like pretty much any other chain that serves basic brewhouse fare but at least with a calorie tracker  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...what you'd expect from a family-style mall eatery  SERVICE - 3 stars...I honestly don't remember  TOTAL - 3 stars...if you need an inoffensive bite before your flight",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=500

Servers are young and often inattentive.  They attempt to take your entire order, stack each course up on the table before you've had a chance to enjoy or barely taste your appetizer, salad or soup.  There were 4 of us this evening and no one got a refill, 2nd beer, ice tea, etc without first flagging down a staff member who then called our server.  Being familiar with this style of service, I simply don't order all at once which forces the server to space the courses out a bit and actually allows us to enjoy the food.  It wasn't a Friday evening with a long wait.  There were several empty tables in our server's station and he could have done a little better.  Our appetizers were tasty, but my wife's Asparagus salad didn't come with its asparagus.  We mentioned it...  but it never came.  Another member in our party never got her salad either.  Once again, we mentioned it, but it too, never came.

Don M.,"Corona, CA",0,8,6,1.0,11/30/2016,"If I could give it a zero I would. This is not typical of service I would expect at this restaurant. This was a not overly crowded night at all, we were seated immediately. I had to get up out of my seat and ask another server to locate my server after several servers passed by. The service was slow, And although our server was nice it was overshadowed by the slowness and inattention to getting orders serving the food and overall non-customer friendly atmosphere. food was OK, at least we didn't get sick, and my strawberry lemonade was lukewarm with approximately five ice cubes in it. I had to ask for water twice before I received it after another long delay. there was no silverware at the table.  When I receive good service, I will be the first to write about it, but the service was absolutely unacceptable. If not for the fact we just arrived out of town on a flight and had no other restaurant alternatives nearby we would've gotten up and left.

She also said that some of the things on the flyer weren't available here, but never said which were or were not available.  When we did receive our order one entree was wrong (why would you put onion strings on a Burger you acknowledged and referred to as Gluten Free), one was missing and didn't arrive until everyone else had finished and we never got a refill of our drinks.

Jay D.,"Concord, CA",106,38,1,1.0,3/15/2017,"So I have a number of issues I have experienced during the last month which is funny since we go on non peak times when most of the staff are just standing around. Being the supposed decent dessert place opened late in San Bruno, its not like there is another alternative to go elsewhere so apparently give BJs more chances than it deserves, though HOOTER's San Bruno has permanently burned a page in my book. Honestly you'd think the pazookie was one they have mastered and could not screw up. WRONG! So we ordered a total of 5 pazookies, which normally they are cooked well with crispy bottoms. though these was really doughy, had a grainy consistency and by morning I at least know two of us experienced stomach issues. It honestly does not seem like things will get better, which I agree with other posts that if it wasn't the closest thing that sold dessert opened late, it probably wouldn't still be in business. You can view by amount of dislike for the brand that if another late night spot like a buffalo wild wings came in that it would destroy the BJs since people like Diane who work there give it a lousy name though she is one of a few people who work for the BJs brand who experience a piss poor attitude and lack of urgency that they experience more time fraternizing and ignoring the request of their clientle. Probably also would have been better if they at least acted like they wanted to help and smiled. I hope BJs does what Chipotle did and hold a company wide meeting to improve quality and the face of their brand. Oh and I forgot to add that my appetizers tend to be non existent since they usually are burnt beyond the point of where they can even be consumed where my potato skins essentially were literally just the skin since they were burnt to the point where the potato itself didn't exist anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=540

There's usually a wait so what I usually do is call in ahead of time and put my name down since they don't take reservations. I've eaten here during lunch before where they give you food while you wait (I've gotten pizza slices before!). This BJ's is at such a great location and even though there's a long wait at times, I just grab the pager I'm given and go shopping! Today, with 9 of us for my friend's birthday, we were told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours (on a Sunday night). It took a littles less than that and after checking in a couple of times, we were seated. I ordered the Chicken Pesto Flatbread and that was enough to fill me up. My friends had the potato skin appetizers and they said that filled them up so much that they could barely finish their entree! Service was great as usual. The waiter was friendly and we instantly connected. He even cracked some jokes and was really patient with us even though we were a bit loud and indecisive at times.  Food came out fast and no one had complaints. I loved what I ordered even though usually I order Cobb Salad, Turkey Avocado Sandwich, or one of their deep dish (Buffalo Chicken) pizzas.  I love coming here on birthdays because they give out complimentary mini Chocolate Chip Pazookies with a candle. Prices are decent. It's not cheap but it's pretty worth it for the portion size.

I tried to flag down a server with no luck. I went up to the front and  interrupted 2 employees chatting.  The guy came to our table and saw the beetle crawling on the plate and removed the food to the back and said he would have someone come over. After waiting 10-15 minutes and no one coming to our table I went up to the front and asked the hostess to get the manager. I waited there for about 10 minutes and asked again for manager. She said he is in his office and said he should be out soon. I waited up front a while longer and could see the manager coming this way but stopping to talk to some staff along the way. When he finally got to me he asked what I wanted. I told him about the beetle and instead of apologizing he asked what type of beetle it was and what it looked like! When I told him I didn't know what type and did that really matter, it crawled out of the salad! He said he would give me a gift card if that would help. I did take the gift card but I'm not sure if I will ever go to a BJs again and I know for sure I will never go back to this one.

Once we made him aware of the double charge, he then SNATCHED the receipt from my mom's hand. Rude!

Quite frankly, I understand why he was being sent home and why the other server was taking over.

JD G.,"Austin, TX",323,182,52,3.0,7/24/2015,"This place is ALWAYS packed and the experience is never that great. It starts out in the crappy mall parking lot that needed to be re-surfaced 10 years ago, with no parking. Once you're actually able to make it inside, you have to wait forever to get sat. This would be understandable at most popular restaurants as they can't seat everyone at once, but when you do get sat eventually, you realize that the reason you've been waiting for an hour is because the kitchen takes an hour to even bring out your food once you order it. I went with a couple friends and after telling us the wait was 30 minutes, it ended up being an hour. The greeters were apologetic about it, and once we were sat, the server was very friendly. We ordered our food and waited...and waited...and waited. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is pre-made, with fries. My friends also ordered entrees that would have been pre-prepared so there was really no reason for the wait. What made it worse was once I got my sandwich, it had maybe a spoonful of pulled pork on it. I never ask for a manager but I did to ask if that was a normal portion for that meal, and he took one look at it and before I even said what was wrong, he apologized and took it back to get a larger portion, which took another 15 minutes. He was extremely apologetic and, while I didn't ask for any compensation, he gave me my meal for free. The pulled pork, though, was amazing! And the fries are so good as well...definitely some of my favorite fries of any restaurant (except McDonald's of course). I've been to this location several times and the experience has always been similar (friendly staff but long waits).

The string beans and mashed potatoes were great, but the steak was not. When I order sirloin elsewhere, it is not grainy (for lack of a better word...please reference my pictures). It was juicy, but the texture was so off putting! It did not taste like steak at all.  The dessert was AMAZING. We ordered a 3 pan pizookie plate (about $10), and it was so worth it. You get to choose which three cookie flavors you'd like to have. We chose the double chocolate, white chocolate and macadamia, and a regular cookie--all topped with vanilla ice cream. The white chocolate was surprisingly less sweet compared to the other two. The double chocolate wasn't as sweet as I had expected it to be. The regular cookie was my favorite though.

Alan S.,"Redwood Shores, CA",66,60,70,1.0,11/6/2015,"Went to BJ's at 1pm on a Friday. Not busy at all, and we were seated promptly. Things kind of went downhill from there. Tried to order a Coke, but they don't serve Coca-cola products. Ordered a root beer, and was told the taps were broken(?). Finally able to get an iced tea. Ordered a bison burger and chicken flatbread. Items took a bit long to arrive, esp considering the place was not busy (I'm guessing it was 20 min?). Then the topper: the server delivered my meal, but then proceeded to pull a hair out from the burger. Yep. I guess it was good that he spotted it, and he did ask the kitchen to re-make the order, but it was pretty gross... Burger was delivered a few minutes later by the manager (why did it get delivered so quickly this time?), but kind of lost my appetite at that point. Took forever to get the check (server seemed to be talking with another customer throughout our time at the restaurant). When the check arrived, we expected the burger to have been taken off the menu at least, but instead, we were charged TWICE for the order. Finally able to get the second charge taken off but no offer to take off the first or even an apology from the manager. I have thought long and hard about writing this review, especially given the rating, but I think it's completely appropriate given my experience this time, and the 3 other times I've attempted to give BJ's a shot (two other times at the Foster City location, another time here). Every time I've had either lost/wrong order, slow service, food return, etc. I don't consider myself picky, but just not acceptable. Message to BJ's: you are really a disaster. Maybe I've been very unlucky, but I'm not coming back here again and recommending against anyone ever wanting to go there. Your prices put you in competition with places that offer far better quality of food and customer service. I hope you figure it out for the sake of the longevity of your company, but it will not be with my support.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=460

Paul B.,"San Bruno, CA",6,19,,1.0,4/6/2016,"This is the LAST TIME I will ever eat at a BJ's Restaurant! I keep returning, hoping it will change but it just gets worse.  I have operated businesses for over 20 years and can't think of a chain restaurant in more diss array.  The management obviously doesn't care about their customers or the business.  Here's what's wrong with BJ's:  1. Food is below average at best!...always undercooked, overlooked, missing standard ingredients/accompaniments, 2. Slowest kitchen in the area, hands down, 3. Your order will almost always be a mistake, 4. The manager will be non existent & often playing with his/her staff in the BOH or FOH, with no regard for their actual job, 5. Your waiter/waitress will be brand new with little to no experience and often leave for lengths of time with out checking on you, 6. YOU WILL WAIT (on avg.) ""1 hour"" MIN TO RECEIVE YOUR FOOD, 7. You will ask to talk to the manager about your food delay and he will cower in the BOH & never come out to address the problem., 8. You will make a reservation only to find out that once you arrive, you will wait another 20-30 minutes while they lie and say ""we're clearing your table now"" (that means they never took your reservation). Bottom line....been here probably 12x, with varying size parties, always a problem, managers are a joke, wait staff untrained at best, food is substandard, food is always a hellacious wait, restaurant is dirty, and overcrowded.  I feel like applying to run this restaurant as it has so much promise but so much of it is broken!  Does the Regional Manager even know what's happening with this restaurant?  Does the corporation even care?  Whomever is the CEO of BJ's should be ashamed of this location!  It's down right awful.

While they do offer a nice location (right at the end of the mall) and plenty of booths, TVs, indoor/outdoor seating, I just never get a good vibe or hot food when I dine there. The servers are always nice, but regularly switch shifts in the middle of our meal. I don't need to get to know you, or your co-worker, this isn't fine dining. But ok, they are friendly, espcially when I've gone in with my BFF and her baby, everyone dotes on her, offers baby-appropriate snacks, etc. but the hosts/hotesses could use an attitidue adjustment. Um, I'm sorry, am I inconveniencing you by asking to be seated while you're working? Is that not your job? Have you ever heard of smiling/greeting customers? We have ordered the Flatbread Pizzas, but they have never really been hot and the flavors are  just kind of... bleh. I had the clam chowder followed by a Pazzuci (sp?) that I shared with two friends which gave me an awful feeling and caused me to be sick when I got home. I have also tried the Halibut fish tacos and they were bland. I think it really depends on what you order. When BFF got the baby a chicken tenders with fries meal, baby mushed up the fries, we ate the tenders which were really hot and yummy, but that's such a basic item that anyone could get right.

The service was horrible. I have them 1 star because the garlic knots, my friends steak dinner & our desserts were delicious (minus the they were too heavy with the salt on the Salted Caramel Pizzooke.

It started from the point of ordering. I ordered the California scramble, and my dad ordered another breakfast entree. The kicker is when they asked him how he wanted his eggs done. He replied poached. First, off the waitress did not know what poached eggs were, then she said they didn't do that here and it is not on the menu. Fun fact, none of the style of eggs are on the menu, I didn't see, ""choose your style of eggs, sunnyside, scrambled, over easy."" Anyway, they ""accommodated"" us, which lead to the manager coming over saying how they had to ""accommodate"" us since poached eggs is not a typical option and for us to not expect it in the future. I had no idea that poached eggs were so difficult. Following the egg debacle, the service continued downhill where they didn't refill our drinks when we asked them to. Furthermore, we had asked for a pizza to be prepared to take away at the end of our meal, that was forgotten, extending our horrendous dining by another 20 minutes while they made it.

Thick cut wedge fries... MMmmmmm. This burger was so big that I wasn't able to finish it. I gave my bf the other half and still was stuffed after. I soo recommend this! New Orleans Jambalaya $15.50: This was also really good, a lot of peppers (so if you don't like peppers, don't order this dish). The shrimp is also big enough to notice and taste. Downside to this dish is that they didn't cut the sausage up completely, so you get one whole sausage slices connected by the outer skin... no bueno. But dish was full of flavor. Service is really slow, we didn't get our drinks tell really late and didn't get our check for the longest time. We started to get anxious because we had a movie to get to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=600

Just kidding, I'm sure it's just a name. They gave me the weirdest look when I asked, though. You would think that they get it a lot! The food was so sub-par that I don't quite remember anything about what I had ordered or eaten. Some kind of deep-dish pizza, I think. The service was slow, and the food came out lukewarm. Ah, THAT was what happened. If not for the pazookie - which I found AMAZING; former pazookie virgin here! - I wouldn't even bother giving this place two stars.

Erika C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",144,32,5,2.0,5/25/2016,"So lets start out by saying we informed the waiter we were on a time restraint. Our waiter was this young guy by the name of Michael B. So I wanted to get relaxed as I was catching a redeye flight to Miami. First off there were three of us that had ordered alcoholic drinks. Michael felt the need to have me go back out to the car to get my I.D,;however he didn't card my sister or my other buddy. Michael literally didn't put my drink until I returned with my I.D. Okay, maybe he really thought I wasn't 21!!! Hmmmmmm So we put our order in 20 minutes had passed and the waiter had yet to give us utensils or go and check on our order. The manager was soooooo compensating for this young punk's arrogance ass attitude. My sister had waved to get our waiter's attention and he sent another staff to help us out. As a matter of fact all the other staff was very helpful accept our own waiter. So now I'm growing impatient and I ask the waiter if he could see how long b4 our food was ready. He stated that he hadnt had a chance to check on the food. MICHAEL B had checked on every customer 2-3 more than he had on us. The manager again stepped in and apologized and had comped some items due to dumb dumbs lack of customer service. I had asked the manager if she could get our bill because we needed to leave. The manager complied and got the bill for us. As we sat there our waiter again, continues to ignore us as if we weren't sitting there..I go up front to pay the bill and the young lady tells me only my waiter can close out my bill. The staff goes to relay the message as she sees that I'm frustrated and growing impatient. Michael B comes to close out the bill and literally starts walking slow, talking to his co-workers and just taking his sweet time to swipe my card. I had to just be silent; otherwise I would've grabbed him by that punkass ponytail and went Bam Bam on him!!!! I am very gracious and good about compensating and giving waiters tips,but this imbecile deserved absolutely nothing but a punch in tha face!!! If I should ever go back to that BJ's I will refuse service if he has to wait on me. It is very sad to have an asshole like that while all the others are working diligently to satisfy the customers! His parents must own the establishment because I do NOT understand why he is still employed there!! MICHAEL B, YOU are exactly the first letter or your last name!!!

Dean N.,"San Francisco, CA",39,108,95,2.0,6/5/2016,"Walking in I was struck by the lack of character. I was not expecting much, however I had a recommendation and their previous recommendation was not horrible. Then I got my hopes up remembering a great microbrewery in Boston and a couple in NYC. I didn't have any beer there, so maybe if I had then my experience would have been different.  However their home-brewed soft drinks were undrinkable. I would list those drinks on my ""the worst thing I ever ate"" list, so even if I tried their beer I doubt any changes. appetizer was potato skins, which I almost stopped ordering because they are horrible so many places, these came out looking good, but no sour cream and fake bacon. Glad I was hungry.  For entree I had a steak, potato and asparagus. Steak was cooked almost correctly, at least rare and two bites were amazing. If they had talent or skill amazing things could have happened in their kitchen. Baked potato was blah. Asparagus tasted liked they scraped their shrimp sauce off before serving, even served cold. Finally, for a tie breaker I had dessert, and since national donut day was last week I decides to try their beignet. I mean... how can they mess those up. Well they far exceeded their incompetence. The gelato was one of my favorite brands, but hidden under their canned whipped cream and strawberries that were sour, and had a weird oily covering I guess to supply the flavor that was lacking. Two stars for the attempt to cook a steak. At least they achieved a correct internal temperature and two flavorful bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=600

Judith L.,"San Francisco, CA",306,140,311,3.0,12/6/2012,"BJ's is always a good place to go for a quick bite if you don't know what you're craving for. It has a wide variety to choose from and there's bound to be something that will catch your eye..or should I say your stomach?   If you're looking for something small, I'd say try the gourmet Mac n cheese.  ""What makes it so gourmet?"" ""I don't know...the bacon? The bread on the side? The bread crumbs sprinkled on the top?"" I don't know if that makes this Mac n cheese gourmet or not but it definitely makes a good snack. It's pretty cheesy and best eaten when it's hot, so remember not to leave it for last.  I've also had the ahi-tuna salad before. It was after the gym so I had to have something light or else...man, all that effort wasted. It was definitely a good choice. It was filling yet light. The tuna complimented the salad well.  The chicken quesadillas were so-so. It's a cheap meal for lunch, but not satisfying. D had the Chicken Marsala once and he said the noodles were a bit hard. But definitely get the pizookie if you want dessert!! I get the red velvet one every time. Super delicious but not something you can finish by yourself (unless you have a super big sweet tooth). Long story short: The food can be a hit-or-miss but BJ's is just one of those places where you don't pay for amazing food or expect too much. The service is definitely forgettable though. Sometimes you have to ask five times just for a glass or water.

Jade T.,"San Francisco, CA",156,325,1069,2.0,5/25/2014,"Came here because one of my friends and I like to have Pizookie dates once a year.. and we didn't like our experience at this one at all. The decor feels a bit outdated compared to the other BJs, with low ceilings and very dark lights. It was incredibly busy on a week night (and hearing from others, it seems like it's packed everyday) and the servers just seemed really unprofessional. They were commenting on other patrons, rolling their eyes and two walked by adjusting their pants.. enough that they should have just done it in a back room / bathroom. Nobody wants to see that while eating, c'mon. My pasta dish was okay, while the salad was so bland that my vegetarian friend couldn't even finish it. We were sure some ingredients had been left off of it. The funniest part was when our Pizookie came. It looked burnt all around the edges, and when my friend tried to spoon some.. she couldn't even break through the top crust! We laughed, which attracted the attention of our server, who asked if it was too hard. When we said yes, he said he thought so... then why would he still bring it out? He ended up replacing it with a ""good"" one, no harm done. Overall off experience, but hey.. at least it's only once a year! I gotta say though.. a hard Pizookie is a very sad Pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=640
David M.,"San Francisco, CA",169,34,16,1.0,4/1/2014,"Don't be fooled. This ""brewhouse"" is just another corporate sham. The service is shoddy -- bring the wrong food out, apps coming out at the same time as entrees, lack of customer service -- the food is meh, and their ""Deep-Dish"" pizza has nothing deep dish about it. It needs to be re-named ""Thick-Crust"" pizza. Deep dish pizza has sauce on top with pie-like attributes.

After about 35 mins, we decided to go inside to ask how much longer. They messed up and said the reason why it took longer is because they put us down for four. Uh doesn't make sense. - got seated outside (area by Barnes and Noble) at a table that's seriously hidden which also didn't make sense because there were two booths open. When the host brought us to our table, we saw that there were still plates and cups. - waited about 15 mins for our server. - complained about how there was something in my water and got no apology. - all the workers that came to our table were impolite   Literally 5 mins after we got our food we decided to just take the food to go.

The reason that this place isn't demoted down to 1 star is because of the wait staff that really did try to be friendly and helpful, and because of its location.

Super crazy, but I feel that for football fans its a great place. Everyone cheers when something good happens and yells when something bad happens. Its very spirited and my friends loved it! But personally I just wanted dinner. They have TVs everywhere and I am sure that from every booth anyone can get a good view.  I love the deep dish pizza, esp the great white but this time I tried something different. I tried one of the low calories dish and to my surprise it was super delicious too!

After about an hour wait we were finally seated with no silverware and our waiter took another 15 minutes to get our drink orders. Another 30 minutes later our food finally came and it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time because the noodles in my pasta were crunchy and stuck together and it was not warm.

The Mahi was Luke warm when it arrived, inedible . The garlic knot was hard as a rock. Called the manager. She said she would get me something else... Let me remind you the ahi salad... Still not arrived. So I ordered the kale brussel sprout salad, which she said would be ""super speedy"". 15 min later both showed up. Unfortunately you could not eat the brussel sprouts because they were not cooked fully. I guess that would have taken another 15 min. No wait, it's a cold salad and they should have been ready ! Good news is the ahi salad was edible . They also charged us for everything which if they were smart they might have at least in good faith have given me the salad.

Alyssa M.,"San Francisco, CA",88,78,26,1.0,6/27/2015,"I would like to start off by saying I have only been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations.  Foster City: service is slow. Staff is attentive to their designated tables. Good customer service. Sometimes I've had to flag another waiter to get my tables check because our waiter went MIA. Overall descent.  San Bruno: service is slow. Staff is not attentive to their designated area. Customer service lacks any sort of quality. The wait is always long because it's a smaller location inside a mall. On my most recent visit, I walked in and saw an empty booth I wanted but was dirty. I stood there for a few minutes and no one came. So we sat at a high top table. There were 3 servers all helping tables around where I was sitting and it started to feel awkward when we weren't being helped. It was out lunch break and we didn't have time to sit and wait for someone to never help us. After 5 minutes a waiter walked over to the table next to me, that sat down after me and he took their order. He walked right by me and wouldn't make any eye contact. If I was sitting at a table where no one was working, one he could have told me he would take care of us or had us move to his section, maybe a table over. But no. Him and 3 other servers kept walking past us. Didn't ask us anything and weren't planning on helping us at all. I walked up to the bar and the bartender just so happened to be extremely apologetic and hospitable.  However my order came out wrong and it took forever to fix and by the time I got it and started to eat we had been there for 45 minutes! I do not recommend the San Bruno location at all. I overheard a server say it was going to be a good day for him because he got 20% on his first table. Wow. There were guys that sat down after U.S. But behind us and they got up and left about 15 min of waiting and no one came to help them.  As a former server, I felt so angry at the workers for not informing me someone wasn't here yet, they could have helped me!

Kjeld P.,"San Francisco, CA",84,11,,4.0,9/28/2015,"I'm writing this because this place doesn't deserve a 2.5 stars rating. I think the expectations for it, is high, because the way the place looks, and a bit on the prices you expect maybe a little more. Most complaints have being on the waiting time and on the food not being close to the amount it costs, their prices are on the 10,20s range, the salads could be less, and cost the same amount of the burgers. I always went with a burger and a beer, and left satisfied, if their selection has fewer things they could maybe get a better rating. I never had the waiting be too long, maybe came here on a weekday and lucked out. But again if you compare a 2.5 star place with this you know this is better, and I'm happy to have it as an option as there aren't many places like it around. As for the people running,  -less on the menu, make it tastier, fresher -keep the good waiters, they have them, be more efficient on unattended tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=560
V W.,"Las Vegas, NV",572,602,197,2.0,5/14/2014,"I really wanted to give BJ'S at least 3 stars, but unfortunately I can't.  Here are the two reasons why I'm giving them 2 stars. I came in last weekend with my husband and I ordered an asian salad off the light menu and they got my order wrong twice.  I had request no onions or bell peppers in my salad and both times my salad arrived with those items on it. By the third time I was just starving so I ended up picking out all the items off my salad. In all honesty I would have enjoyed my salad if I hadn't spend so much time picking through it. The other thing that made this visit very memorable in a bad way is that a few hours later my husband began to feel queazy and we figured it was the burger he had. He ordered a bison burger done medium well and it was obviously undercooked and or mishandled. My husband spent the entire night vomiting with other symptoms, which only means 1 thing. Food poisoning!!! I'll say that I've been to other BJ's many times and everything was about a 3 star review, but this visit was probably the absolute worst and most likely I will never come back or recommend this place to anyone.

Here's the reference number for the receipt: 0612010000452 Feel free to contact me for more details.  I hope you all don't just ignore your customers on social media. First, let me start off by saying I totally understand that today is a busy day. Game 4 Spurs vs Miami, you know everyone is at BJ's trying to catch the game. We ordered food for pickup and our friends went ahead and picked it up for everyone in the house. This is what we ordered: 1. Bison Burger 2. Shrimp Scampi Pasta 3. Cajun Pasta 4. Shrimp Tacos Once there, my friends were told that the order will be ready in less than 10 minutes. An hour later, they were still waiting for the Shrimp Tacos. They left before the game started and came back after half-time (imagine that-- 10 minutes my ass.) Secondly, when the food arrived, we found out that the Scampi Pasta wasn't even there. We got Alfredo Fettucine instead. SERIOUSLY?! It was already an hour long and then you couldn't even get the order right?! Then when we tried to call Mr. William Morthole, the Senior Manager (he provided his card and told us that he will take care of us next time--thanks for the gesture) and he was busy on the phone and couldn't call us back. We called again to get assistance from a different manager and the ""best"" she could do was price adjust the meal.  I'm sorry. That's not the best you could do. I ordered a Shrimp Scampi and got forced to eat a bland fettuccine alfredo. What if I had been a pescatarian, would you have told me that the best you could do was price adjust my meal that I couldn't even eat? Should I even be paying for a meal I did NOT want? NO. This meal should've been given to me for free. And as I just got off work and was ready to eat dinner, I ate it. I sucked it up and ate a meal i did not want.  This is what I think BJ's should've done: 1. Don't tell us that the meal is ready in ten minutes when its not. Say it will be ready in an hour if its going to be ready for an hour. 2. Don't offer your card and contact number if you have no interest on following up. 3. Don't let your customer pay for food they didn't order -- clearly this is a fuck up on your end--this means it should be on the house.

After we had an encounter with James. The service was much better.  The waiter we got his name was Miguel.

Donald W.,"San Francisco, CA",115,188,1331,1.0,8/5/2014,"I've got to say that this is by far the worst BJ's that I have ever been to, and I personally used to love this location. This is now the fifth time that my wife and I have come to this particular location in hopes that Service would've become better and within a year and a half span it has only gotten worse. The only reason why I didn't that place a one star is because of two really good employees. First, is the senior manager named Brandi Jordan who's leadership skills showed that she cares about the customers, and although the issues didn't happen on her watch. She made sure to comp our dinner and even invite us back for much better service in the future.  Second was a wonderful waitress named Kelly Liu. She wasn't even our waitress been made sure to constantly check up on us after our poor service and continued to apologize as well as do her best to make us happy. It really meant slot because her section was on the opposite side of ours and yet she still made sure to make a terrible situation decent.  Now back to the review. It first started off badly when it took 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge the fact that we were sitting down in a booth waiting to be served. I had to forcibly grab a waitresses attention just to be given our water. As she was delivering them she gave my wife and I terrible attitude and begin to roll her eyes as if we were disturbing her at her. Really, you have an attitude because paying customers wanna be served. Get over yourself lady. I then asked to speak to the manager on duty which was Brandy. She was just as troubled as to why there was such awful service. This is now 45 minutes into being at BJ's and we still have not received one dish yet. It took another 15 minutes to receive our appetizers by then it had been a full hour since we arrived and we just received our appetizers. Unfortunately for us the cheese sticks were barely warm and the spinach & artichoke dip we ordered were completely cold. So cold and that we sent it back after one bit. An hour and a half after we arrived we finally got our main dish and our mixed drinks. I was truly disgusted to find cakes on filth surrounding my drinking glass. So bad it was everywhere as if know one attempted to wash the glass. I had to send my drinks back. But once again Kelly made sure to apologize for the mix up and made sure that our main course was hot and satisfied our needs. She even brought over new drinks for us and would leave until we were happy. She constantly kept a smile on her face and made sure to explain what was going on. I've learned that no matter how many people they hire and how much time goes by the service at this particular location just continues to get worse and worse. Occasionally you'll find a few diamonds in the rough like Kelly, who really take their job seriously and treat their customers with compassion but unfortunately there's not enough of her to turn around this said establishment.  In my opinion if you do go to BJ's only go when it's slow. Otherwise you will be set up for disappointment and considerable letdown. At this point I'm done with this place and refuse to go back, no matter what!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=560
Johnny G.,"San Francisco, CA",287,214,38,1.0,4/21/2014,"Everytime I come to BJ's, it's a disappointment. The wait for a table here is outrageous. Honestly, if you want a place to kick it with friends over beer and food, BJ's would be the ideal place right? This place looks great based on their menu but their service is SLOW and the wait here is stupid LONG.  My friend got here at 7PM on a Thursday night to grab a table for 7. Keep in mind that it's Thursday night and the tables weren't even filled.  I arrived at 7:45 PM, 45 minutes after my friend already put his name down for a table. As soon as I arrive, I asked the lady in the front how much longer and she said 15 mins.  So I sit back down and wait patiently. 20 minutes later, I ask her again and she tells me another 15-20 mins. Ok...you said that 20 minutes ago and we already waited a little over an hour. How about you give us an accurate time? 20 minutes later, I ask her AGAIN and she tells me they're ""setting"" up the table. Long story longer, we waited damn near 2 hours for a table here. My friend got here at 7PM and we didn't even get seated til damn near 9PM.  Funny thing is they decide to open up the back tables after WE were seated. They had a bunch of OPEN seats in the back.

The hostess carefully walked us down the busy walkway and that's when Leggio noticed my awkward gait and offered to seat us in his section. ""VIP"" he adds. He chose to seat us at a large booth that could have accommodated a small family or a group of friends. We had a lot of space which was great for me because I hadn't taken my medication yet and my legs were hurting. And so we ordered a Dr pepper and a glass of water which were promptly delivered. We then started with calamari and potato skins. For our entrees we chose the unlimited soup and salad and the portabello burger with thin fries.

We asked for separate tabs and he gave us some look like, ""Uhhh, wtf? Okay? Fine."" Uhhh hello! Some of us like separate tabs so that we don't have to deal with who owes who what.  Then, my friend gets his chili and it's lukewarm! Last time I checked, chili is supposed to be hot. We explained this to the waiter and we get another kind of look except it wasn't as obvious. (He probably heard us talking about the first time and giving a low tip because when he would come back, he was more energetic and upbeat with his tone.) So now I get my crispy chicken sandwich with fries. I love their thin-cut fries. Mmmm! As I was eating the sandwich, I noticed that the tomato was MUSH! Gross. It looked like it was a spread on my chicken instead. I tried to take it off but only the rim came off. That's how bad the tomato was. C'mon BJ's! If I'm paying $10 for a sandwich, the least you can do is give me a fresh tomato! And I'd like to add that another time I came with a group of friends, our waitress was kind but was rushing us. It felt like she was trying to get us out asap. RUDE. About only 30 minutes into our meal, she was already asking us if we needed boxes. We weren't even done yet! -___- And this last time (I mentioned above), our waiter was really slow. I needed a few more minutes to decide what to order, and he comes back like 10 minutes later and it wasn't even busy. Now I need a refill which I told him, and I wait another 5 minutes.

Addy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",425,53,148,2.0,1/7/2014,"It was an alright experience. I don't think it was worth our wait nor the cost of food. We waited over 2 hours for a table for 8. Yes, my friend didn't make reservations prior, but I think it's reasonable to let your customers know you can't sit there forever. After quite some wait for the waiter to come around with water, then to take our orders, I asked for the BlueHouse cheeseburger w/ wedge-cut fries. The fries were good, but the burger was nothing special nor worth the $9-10. It was just a bit over the size of an In-N-Out burger, and the meat was dry and flavorless. My friends ordered some drinks, and the cider was fruity, fizzy, and you can hardly taste the alcohol (I'm not saying this is a bad thing, though!) Regarding the service, some of my friends ordered thin-cut fries but received fries that were wedge-cut. The waiter informed us after we all received our dishes that they had ran out of thin-cut fries. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but customer service-oriented workers would make sure that their clients knew what they would be paying for beforehand. I, for a fact, would've ordered a salad if they ran out of wedge-cut fries. We were celebrating my friend's birthday, so we ordered a 3-set mini pizooki platter: red velvet, double chocolate, and white macadamia (not sure of the actual dish names). The dessert took a while to arrive, but eventually, out of the corner of my eye, our waitress seems to walk in slo-mo as she delivers our pizooki topped with ... half-melted vanilla ice cream. This was the most disheartening part of the night for me. I've been to BJ's before and I was never served dripping, melted, sad ice cream. Considering that the double chocolate cookie was very yummy, its presentation was a huge disappointment.

The server was a sweet gentleman, but could not get the order right for half of the table. We came with a table of 9 around 7:45pm on a Sunday night to watch the game. The wait was about 45 minutes. I ordered the chicken club (recommended by the server) without mayo and with the bacon on the side (to share with my sister).  Food came with mayo and with no bacon. I let the mayo slide although this could be a health request. Nevertheless, I reminded the server that I wanted the bacon on the side. Another person at my table did not get her correct order either. It was also my sister's bday, so we wanted to get a pizooki sampler (3 small pizookis). I asked him quietly on the side to present it with a candle to my sister sitting a few seats away from me on the other side of the table (which I pointed out). He comes back with one chocolate pizooki with a candle and asks me which person it goes to. Not the right order. Not longer a surprise. Not happy at this point. I mentioned to him that was not what I ordered, and he immediately put in the request for the pizooki. By that time, no one wanted to eat a pizooki anymore. Literally 2 minutes after I asked for the order to be cancelled. He ""asked his manager"" and couldn't cancel the order because they were in the process of making the platter. .................................... Really? For someone who keeps on f'ing up orders, the least you can do is to  cancel this. No one wants to eat the mediocre food anymore. Get the pizooki, no one wants to eat it, asked for the check. Split the checks with 3 cards (the limit) and wrote the card names and totals at the top of the bill. He came back with some random totals for each card. Wth??? He also said one of the cards declined... which was weird, because it worked earlier for this person. Confused. When he I returned, I told him the totals were at the top and that he mischarged multiple credit cards. He apologized and went back to fix the mistake. This included running my friend's card again which went through fine. Service is a huge part of the dining out experience! I should not have to feel stressed or annoyed when I'm eating out. Not sure what's up with the waiters here (or manager for not cancelling a pizooki order--seriously, it's worth $ and can be disposed of), but I would not come again.

There weren't too many people there on a Wednesday afternoon, so seating 12 of us was rather easy, except for how we had to squish everyone in at those high tables. $2 off appetizers was nice, and I got potato skins, which were surprisingly good with the sauce they provided..it kind of tasted like a bleu cheese dressing almost, but that, along with the company was probably the best part of the gathering. BJ's Blonde Ale was just alright, and I finished it pretty quickly, but the trouble came when the waitress delivered the check...first, she refused to split the check by person and then gave us a max of 6 transactions, forcing a lot of us to use cash. Not only that, but after we figured out how much everyone owed with tax and tip included, we put the amount we wanted charged on each card on the receipt. Upon getting the cards back, not only did the waitress charge someone twice, but there was tip added on to the amounts that we had written down, and cash was given in a ten and a five dollar bill...we were so confused as to why she did not take the cash and charged what we had asked on the cards. Being way too confusing to work out each individual person's, we just coped with it and attempted to split the cash afterwards, but that latter part of happy hour was mostly raised eyebrows and arms as to why the waitress did this...

I've had my fair share of food from here: Very first thing I ordered here was their Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizza.  I ordered a Medium, but that sucker was huge!  But if you know me, I usually stay committed to finishing my food and killed it.  It was pretty good, but it won't be for a while if I choose to order it again considering their robust menu. Next time I visited I tried their Jambalaya, with blackened chicken, shrimp, chicken-andouille sausage,bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce all over a bed of rice.  While I remember liking it initially, I totally remember it spiciness kicking my ass!  I have also had their Santa Fe Salad, romaine lettuce, red onions and fire-roasted red peppers tossed with the house Santa Fe dressing and topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, sliced avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crisp tortilla strips and blackened chicken breast.  Definitely not the healthiest of salads, but it was very satisfying! Then I've had Derek's Meatloaf Open Faced Sandwich ( ).  It's another crazy dinner that was really tasty, but will be hard to order again because of the menu as well. And on my most recent visit there, I went a little crazy and ordered their Angus Sliders and Mac & Cheese Small Bite.  It's really hard to not like Sliders, but they were really good and they come in fours instead of the usually two or three ( ).  And then Mac & Cheese ""Small Bite"" was incredible!  Rotelle pasta with three cheeses, chipotle, and garlic topped with breadcrumbs and bacon ( ).  That was so good, that I put some of them into my Sliders and made Mac & Cheese Sliders!!!  OMG, YUM!!!!

Chicken Lettuce Wraps - these were the best. They were really good. The drinks were really good...when you could get them. While our waitress was nice she was mostly absent. I don't know if they were super busy (didn't look like it). We literally had to flag our waitress down for more drinks, water, water refills and she was short with us when we ordered dessert. We were both wondering what she was going to bring to the table as we both ordered the same thing and she started to walk away saying ""ok one of each"". We were like wuh?  She didn't make eye contact with us when walking by our table. Thank goodness my friend was loud when she said ""excuse me"". We were there for over two hours. In her defense, we were talking and visiting so I can see why she didn't want to ""bug"" us but it was pretty bad still.

Plus the guy was nice. By the way the server apologized for the pizza coming in late. The reason was because my mini pizza went to another table somehow and they had to cook (reheat?? idk!) a new one in the kitchen for me...

Char N.,"Portland, OR",27,15,1,5.0,3/10/2014,"I love BJ's. It is what it is, which is a restaurant in a mall, so it is inevitably busy during rush hours and full of people I'd rather have nothing to do with, but for what it is, I adore it. I visit San Bruno frequently, and I eat at BJ's every time, because it is close to where I stay. And there are four great things going for this restaurant: -Despite being busy and having a large staff, a few members always recognize me and have a few words to say. (Chris is one waiter who always stops for a word, since I met him on his first shift.) -They have a large selection of good, imported beers, which I like, since I am a fan of Belgian-style beers--saisons and trips, etc. -Whenever they have been out of a bottled beer I have ordered, a manager comes to apologize and is more than eager to make sure I'm %110 happy. -The tortilla soup, oh my god, the tortilla soup. I could eat it every day and still crave it. Over all, this is a great place to eat, if you realize it is a high-volume, busy establishment during peak hours for lunch and dinner.

This has to to be one of the WORST Bjs experiences that I have ever had in my entire life of eating at plenty Bjs in many different cities! I have never in my life felt so disrespected and just unwelcomed at any restaurant until now. Upon arriving we were seated and told we would be helped right away. Well our definition and their definition of ""right away"" clearly is different! The fact of the matter is they weren't even that busy.. I then had a question about happy hour and so the waitress said oh yeah it's in the bar area! No keep in mind prior to my party moving over to the bar area we were unaware of the fact that it's not offered on Saturdays! Why would the waitress tell us this before we moved over there and made a fool of ourselves asking for items off the happy hour menu? Things just went downhill from there because once we got another waitress about 15 minutes later she then comes over and takes our order and recommends the worse pizza ever! It came out so dry and barely and cheese or sauce! I wasn't going to pay for this $20 supposedly signature deep dish pizza that I couldn't bought in the frozen foods section ion and got an even better quality! Well once we decided we would like to switch the pizza our waitress was no where to be found and then  we saw her walk over to what must be their ""clock out"" station with food in her hand ready to go home! Completely unprofessional because what most professional and accredited restaurants do is smoothly transition the new waiter or waitress to the customer. To add insult to injury my birthday happen to be this night and my friend communicated this to this waitress and do you think she cared enough to pass this information onto the next waiter? Absolutely not! Well this wasn't the case at all. Our new waiter Jeremy had to be one of the worse waiters I've ever experienced too! He had a very nonchalant attitude about our complaints and when my friend got up to complain to the manger she seemed just as unsympathetic about the situation as her staff and that's exactly why I believe they behave the way they do because management itself just doesn't care! My advice is if your unhappy with your job then QUIT! Maybe somebody will read these reviews and actually care from the upper management or maybe we should get the corporate contact number and have them be aware of how this place is being ran because I'm sure it's far from the standards that BJs implements for its staff!

Ellie D.,"San Francisco, CA",9,39,2,1.0,7/20/2014,"If you're trying to place an order over the phone, calls are routed to a call center! Whoa! I learned this for the first time after I was placed on hold for 15 minutes by Jake from State Farm errrr BJs Call Center! Customer service at this location has been declining over the years - I've had a number of not-so-great experiences here and it doesn't seem like management cares to up their game. While I did get a small apology from their manager, Brandy, it was more of a forced apology rather than a genuine one. So I'm writing this review as I'm waiting another 45 minutes on top of my promised pick-up time for my order and I'm wondering what the hold up is to pop out 2 pizzas from the oven. There's another guy waiting next to me who's been waiting for over 30 minutes for his order, too. After 30 minutes, I overhear the staff saying there's a problem with my order, something about the cooks not seeing online orders on their end, so obviously that meant my order hadn't even been started yet at that point. I contemplated walking out but I had already stood there for over 30 minutes.  If you read my other Yelp reviews, I'm a very reasonable person. I don't write negative reviews just because an employee was rude or just because my food didn't come out as expected. But this review is a result of cumulative wtf experiences here. And management doesn't care to improve. If this was a dine-in order, there is absolutely no way someone would wait 45 minutes for a pizza. So it is absolutely unreasonable for a take-out order to take 1 hour for 2 pizzas when typically, as I was told, take-out orders are ready in 15 - 20 minutes. And although Brandy heavily discounted my order, she seemed hesitant to do so and quickly walked away after giving me my receipt without any explanation as to the reason for the long wait.  My other experiences at this location were just as ridiculous. I remember a few years ago when I had a newborn and BJs just started brunch hours (10am I think?). My family and I were there right as they opened and I politely asked if I could be seated somewhere where I could keep my stroller next to me (as I had a baby sleeping inside), and the server looked around the entire restaurant and said ... NO, sorry, we don't have any seats available where you can keep your stroller. What the?! I looked around the entire empty restaurant, as we were the first ones there at 10am, and explained that my newborn was sleeping and being that the restaurant was practically EMPTY, could we just sit in a corner or anywhere for a quick brunch as I had not been out of the house in months (newborn, remember) and she just looked confused and explained that strollers have to be stowed in the front and blah blah blah, I stopped listening and wanted to strangle this b*tch who did not understand how parents of newborns were lacking on sleep and super exhausted and how much effort it took just to get dressed and get a baby out of the house. Excuse the language, it was like de ja vu all over again. In the end, a manager came out and apologized profusely and explained the fire hazard with a stroller blocking a walkway, but offered to let us sit at any corner table or against the wall or somewhere in the back, and practically begged us to stay as we were getting ready to walk away, but I was too upset at that point. And there was this one time we sat and waited 30 minutes at a booth at the bar and the servers were pointing fingers at each other about who was supposed to be taking care of our table. And another time during lunch when we all ordered from the lunch menu or the soup/salad combo and were charged full meals for each item and the server said, ""Oh, I didn't realize you wanted a lunch portion."" But I clearly said, we were all ordering from the lunch menu. And then that started a train of confused servers who were bringing out our meals and then taking them back so that it was a smaller lunch portion. My favorite is when they bring you someone else's order and when you tell them that's not what you ordered, they get upset like it's our fault they're holding 3 dishes in their arms and they don't know where to go. The 1-star is for Vicki, who was incredibly professional handling take-out orders. I would actually give her 5 stars for the way she handled everything. Not once did she roll her eyes or even give me the slightest bit of attitude whenever I came up to ask her how much longer my order would be. She was calm and apologetic, and told me she completely understood why I was so frustrated. She seemed more pulled together than their manager and the other employees. This was probably an off night for take-out orders because I watched her apologize to every single person for the delay with their take-out order, but nevertheless, she was professional. I'm glad to see people like her at the front lines handling all that stress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=740

Soul G.,"San Bruno, CA",8,23,,1.0,5/10/2014,"This BJ is the worst I have ever had and I have never had a bad one in my entire life!! If you don't care about service, ambiance, hot food or your precious time that is constantly leaking from its unknown reservoir, this is the eatery for you! When I walked in the music was shouting out of the speakers, fighting for attention with the hockey game and it's witty announcers.  As I was speaking with the hostess she seemed to be slowly falling asleep so I tapped the counter to wake her up. After some tapping she came around and gave me a buzzer which would notify me when my table was ready for my lovely bride and I to feast on some BJ pizza pie!! 45 minutes later we were seated, 10 minutes later our waiter came by, he was completely stoned on some of Northern California's finest marijuana, we ordered two cocktails which we never received. During our time at the table, we were offered several different dishes that we did not order because we had not ordered yet ! Our waiter came by and asked us if there was anything else we needed, I started laughing so hard I almost woke up the hostess! After he took our order he came by and informed us he was leaving and that another waiter would be waiting on us. Turns out we were the ones waiting. Food came out wrong, cold and long after my hunger pangs left me lost in the glow of shit pop music and dim witted unkempt servers.

We were sat at the balcony section and was approached by our server. He came and did not introduce himself, but instead said ""want somethin' to drink? Ready for your order? Or did you just sit down?"" All in one breath. Luckily, we're regular comers so we knew what we wanted. I ordered strawberry mojito and my friend ordered a strawberry margarita. The strawberry mojito had no alcohol taste but had plenty of soda. I asked for a different drink and it still tasted more as a soda than an alcoholic drink. As for the appetizer, we ordered a lettuce wrap that came with a half-ass presentation of sloppiness. Then he asked if we wanted plates to go with that. Why would you ask if we want plates?! YES WE WANT PLATES. LET ME EAT OFF THE DAMN TABLE. To make matters worse, we also had to ask for silverware and napkins, since he didn't give us any. Waited an average of 30 min for our appetizers. Not once did he check up on how the replacement drink was nor the appetizers. For entrees, I ordered a cherry chipotle glazed salmon and my friend ordered a burger. Waited another 40 min. Total wait was more than an hour. Once again, the server did not check up on how our meal was. Our server name was Tristan. DO NOT GET HIM. Oh and he had the audacity to run out and yell if we payed.

I come here rarely when the family needs a bite to eat and we can't decide on anywhere else.   For me, it's your standard menu, thought I do like the mini appetizers and can just order a bunch of those to nosh on.  The place is definitely loud, which again, reminds me that I'm old and too sensitive to grey noise now.  Service is ok, nothing over the top and nothing that would piss me off, so that's a good thing.  Only caution I would give on going here is that their service for large groups can be slow if you aren't doing a buffet thing.  I've gone with co-workers here for lunch a few times and each one had us late getting back.  If it's a small group, then you should be fine.  Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=740

Of course, she was tired (she's 92!), so when the guy who took our order said 20-25 minutes, she said that was fine, she wanted some books from Barnes and Noble anyway. I set my phone timer for 25 minutes, and when it went off, checked out of the book store and headed back (making it 30 minutes). I was told it would be another 15 minutes or so. I told the guy we weren't going to wait, just give me a refund. So the manager comes over and said ""You asked for a manager?"" and I told him no, I just want my money back and be on my way, we can't wait any longer. He apologized sincerely, refunded my money, and asked if I could wait ONE more minute. I did, and our food was brought out and given to us free of charge. I honestly wasn't expecting a free meal, I was just incensed with the poor service. This has happened before at this BJ's with my daughter, and she told me to not leave a tip. I left a tip because I believe it is not the fault of the servers, but is due to poor management and training. The manager that took care of me today was new, and said he was aware of the problem, and was working on it.  He handled my situation impeccably!

To summarize my past experiences here; sipping my drink through a straw, I look down and a lipstick stain on my glass... barf.  With a group of people, an hour wait for our food and my Scampi Pasta comes out topped with bread crumbs- NO sauce... WTF?! Ordered the Calamari appetizer and was served with no dipping sauce, they ended up being out of it and offered ketchup or ranch... GROSS! BJ's solution to these issues... FREE PIZOOKIE! woopty doo... So it was a nice day and since I had to do a few errands in San Bruno, BJ's outdoor seating sounded good at the time. Our waiter, Billy (name on the receipt) was nice, but very busy. Ordered a Hefeweizen for the bf and a Peach Mojito for myself. A different waiter comes by and places a glass of beer on our table that is not Hefeweizen and walks away before we can even mention it. We tell Billy and he said he'll check on our drinks and to keep it. 15 minutes later, another waiter comes by finally and hands me my Peach Mojito, then looks at my bf- looks at the beer in front of him and offers the Hef. As we start to explain we were given the wrong beer earlier, he makes a face and tells my bf, ""that's not a Hefeweizen but you drank it anyways?"" Let me just say this before I go on, my bf is very well mannered, very laid back-and woulda let that comment slide. Me, I can be, but not when I'm spoken to like that. So I looked at this crazy waiter and said, ""Excuse me, but we have been sitting here for 20 minutes without our drinks, in the sun- you're damn right we drank from it. But since you've finally decided to bring our drinks-TAKE IT!"" And this waiter really did take it. Ridiculous. We get our pizza. I take a slice out of the deep dish pan and put it on on my plate. I touch it, and it felt cold. I touch the slice everywhere, hoping it was just the tomato or something- everything wasn't even warm to the touch. I touch the pan thinking that at least has gotta be hot. Nope. At this point, I just grab the pan with my bare hands. WTF? A deep dish pizza that was just served I can hold with my bare hands. What is wrong with this picture? I walk inside, pan in hand and a waitress asks me if she could help me. I told her to have our waiter take it off my bill. Our waiter comes by and apologizes and asks if I want anything else, but why would I? To prove our waiter was sincere in his apologies he spoke to his manager. The manager came out to apologize and handed me a $15 gift card. Overall, if I was starving I woulda been a straight B****! But I came with the intentions of chillin' in the sun, having a drink and pizza- all I ask for is my pizza to be hot and for the drink waiter- DO NOT GIVE ME ATTITUDE! Who wants this damn $15 card?

Even after discussing all the problems we had with the manager, we felt like our complaints fell on deaf ears. On top of that, when our second waiter of the night brought the bill, he said ""the manager took care of you guys, so have a good night."" Which sounds to a reasonable person as though our bill (which came to about $40) was comped. Nope!!!! They basically took off the items that we ordered and showed up AFTER we finished dinner, and that had been screwed up. Which we should not have had to pay for at all - so glad we didn't - but don't say the manager ""took care of"" us and mislead us about how you're making up for horrendous service! What a joke.

Calvin John B.,"Honolulu, HI",364,118,50,2.0,1/4/2014,"Of the three times that I've eaten there, never have I been completely satisfied with anything other than their beer. Whether it be service or food, most things I've experienced here were just sub-par. I'm not one to complain  too often, but you start to question what is acceptable in terms of the standard of food preparation, quality, taste, and so forth. I'm a pasta person. Parmigiana's, lasagna's spaghetti's and linguini's are my cushion so if it's there, I'll go for it! Every time I get those here, they for some reason end up with only a scoop-full of sauce with the pasta as dry as the desert. Steaks, chickens and other meats are a toss up. Sometimes they're well cooked and other times they're just plain chewy. My most recent trip, and one that nudged me into writing this review, was with a group of co-workers and I for a holiday dinner. One of us ordered take-out from our server for a steak. It came out burnt. We told the server what had happened but in turn we were told that cooks had already been told to prepare it the way we asked. Truth is, we were never asked. Adding to that, when we were ready to pay, we tried raising our hands each time he passed but it wasn't until fifteen minutes later where we eventually asked another server for ours to come by. At times, we even caught him helping other tables out then leaving for the back room again. When he finally came over, he collected our cards and didn't come back for another couple of minutes or so. The entire experience made us pull hairs, as we'd already had a long day at work to begin with. But not all is completely lost. There was a server that sat us and took our orders just fine. He talked stories for a bit, told us he'd been doing this for a very long time/ You can tell by the way he acted towards us - friendly and courteous. I would've been just fine with him as our server, but his shift was about to end and instead we got a newcomer. I'm not denouncing them, but I'm sure the more experienced ones have been through all sorts of craziness. At this point, I'm just going on a rant, but it really makes me think twice about planning another outing to BJ's again - at least to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=680

Has choices pizza to steak to ""I'll try the halibut"" 2. Comfortable casual setting with good bordering on great service. 3. Easy access right off 280 with miles of parking. Bingo Bango Bongo!

Niko P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,10,,1.0,9/9/2013,"We decided to give BJ's one last good faith chance after our rough experience last time. What a mistake this was. BJ's has officially hit the bottom of the barrel.  The experience started with the initial phone call to put our name down on our way in. We have never had a problem with this before and they supposedly welcome call ins. At least you would think so. The girl who answered the phone was rude and snarky. After 5 minutes of telling her that we had some it before she finally allowed it. She was rude from the get go. We should have taken that as a sign. Foolishly we continued forward.  Next, terrible staff. Complete rush job to line their pockets. They rush you to order and are rude about it. I barely finished my order before the menu was ripped out of my hands. Same goes for my dining companion.  While waiting forever for our food, we had a hovering employee literally standing behind our table starting and just waiting. Making us very uncomfortable. Also, it is quite apparent that texting and phone calls are more important than doing your job and talking care of the customer. I watched one girl flat out ignore a customer directly in her line of sight. Only to pull her phone out and type out a lengthy text and then walk away from said customer.  Management isn't much better. Didn't care about any customer concerns or lack of customer service by his employees. He just stood there at the drink station doing nothing. Also having a terrible attitude.  Finally the food gets there. This was after watching 3 innings of the baseball game totaling about 30 minutes. The pizza we ordered was very dry. Little to no sauce whatsoever. That is sad some their pizza used to be awesome. The cajun pasta was undercooked. Very stiff rubbery noodles. Couldn't even flag anyone down to bring it to their attention.  The second it looked like we were done eating, the plates are snatched away and the check was on the table. Good thing I was done with my pasta. I wouldn't have had time to tell them I was still working on it.  This is the worst experience I've had at BJ's ever. There will be no next time from us.

Shaft S.,"San Francisco, CA",53,7,,1.0,1/24/2015,"My wife and I were having repairs done on our car at Sears and walked over to BJs for lunch.  While the menu posted outside suggested above-average bar food, our overall experience was awful.  I hate writing that, but my wife and I want to make sure people know what this place is like.   We walked in and the hostess doesn't talk to us, picks up two menus, and as she is walking into the dining area says ""oh, if you want to sit in the bar it's open seating.""  Based on her surliness, we chose to sit in the bar.   We sat in the bar, were given menus, and introduced to our waitstaff rapidly. They took our drink orders promptly and came back shortly thereafter to get our food orders.  We ordered the buffalo chicken wings for an appetizer, and my wife chose the Barbecue Chicken Chop Salad while I had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich.    20-25 minutes later our food came out.  By ""our food"" I mean a salad without dressing and a cold beef sandwich. I am sure you are wondering about the chicken wings... So were we!   We were half way through our lunch 15 minutes in) when a waitstaff (not our waiter) brings out the chicken wings.  I sent them back and asked they be taken off our bill, but not before seeing a plate of what looked to be chicken pieces from birds ravaged by tuberculosis.  In the long run, we are healthier for not getting them. When our waiter finally came back to our table, about 30 minutes after the last time he came by, he apologized for the wings and we asked him for some salad dressing.  He comes back several minutes later to crack jokes and let us know the chicken was taken off the bill, but forgot the salad dressing.   The kicker of the meal - before we could give our waiter feedback on our crappy experience HE WENT ON LUNCH BREAK!  We were passed to another waiter who also avoided our table for another 20 minutes.   My wife and I do not openly complain about things, but this experience was the worst we have ever had in a restaurant and we will not be going back to this establishment",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=680

I've been lucky to get very good service the past few times I've been here.  I think the drinks are over priced, but the food is better than similar chain restaurants.   Love (4+ stars) 1) BJ's Famous Pizookie - Really indulgent dessert that I love.  Hot of the oven large chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla bean ice cream. Can't go wrong with this one at all!  2) Pizookie Trio - Three small cookies topped w/ ice cream. You can choose between Chocolate Chunck, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter, Oatmeal Raisin Walnut, Cookies 'N Cream or Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli. Haven't tried the Oatmeal or the Cookies 'N Cream, but all the other flavors are great! Like (3 Stars) 1) Great White Pizza - Deep dish pizza with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. I don't enjoy this pizza as much as the first time I ate it a couple years ago, but it's still a good go to.  2) Chicken Wontons (Thai style) - These are good small apps with a great Thair flavor. Nothing amazing...sometimes too oily, but they're a pretty safe bet. 3) Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Nothing special, but they're still pretty good. They do get soggy, so eat them right away! 4) Chicken Potstickers - Really good app, but over priced! I could honestly buy a bag of frozen Potstickers and make the same thing at home. But my gripe is w/ the price, not the taste of the dish. 5) Boneless Chicken Wings (Maui Sweet Teriyaki Glaze) - very good and if you go at the right time they're part of the happy hour special. Great portion size, and great flavor. The glaze was a bit sweet and spicy. Defiantly a safe bet. 6) Island Sunset, Tickled Pink,  & Peechy Keen Snagria - They're all OK drinks, but nothing special at all. Pass (1 or 2 stars) 1) Chicken Wontons (Buffalo style) - These are a hard pass...the flavor just is not there! 2) Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms - These are small app that I thought were VERY bland. 3) Avocado Egg Rolls - Really heavy and greasy.  I can't say I dislike them all together, but I felt a bit sick after eating them they're so rich. 4) Crispy Calamari - I should know better than to order calamari here...it was terrible. Not crispy at all, just chewy and really room temp. The lemon garlic aioli was so incredibly bland. Just BLAH all around.

Really hungry.  So to wait 15 minutes at a table without any greeting was almost enough for us to leave.  We stayed out of hunger pains but still weren't impressed.  Having been a server before, I always followed three rules:  greet someone as soon as they sit down, keep drinks full and take care of the check quickly.  Our server was 0 for 3.  Knowing how difficult the job can be, I still left a decent tip.  It could've been an off night or maybe he was having a rough day.  Still though, it was an expensive meal for such crummy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=680
Chris T.,"San Francisco, CA",321,53,14,1.0,11/3/2013,"I took my son here for what I hoped would be a fun ""guy's night"" dinner where we could watch some college football together. We got there a bit before the rush. It was busy, but since we were only two people, we were seated quickly. Most groups waiting and that were already seated seemed to be 6+. I overheard the manager telling someone who had walked in with a party of 10 that their wait could be 2 hours. So keep that in mind. The food is that kind of perfectly chewable, extremely-loaded-with-calories-and-salt lab-created food that large chain mall restaurants have. It's good because it's engineered that way. I had a french dip that had the most bizarre au jus I've ever tasted -- it was like teriyaki, but not. The server sized us up as being a cheap bill immediately and behaved that way. He asked us if we wanted to order right after being handed the menu, and if I wanted dessert with my mouth full of my entree. Anything that could have gotten us out of there faster would have made him ecstatic. He also had rehearsed jokes (""I'll have a french dip"" .. ""he just left!"") and kept nudging me on the shoulder when he wanted to say something to me. The other thing is, along with the menu, he presented me with a frequent diner card form and said I should fill it out. Throughout the meal, he kept trying to upsell me this stupid frequent diner card, saying things to my son like ""Dad let you use that pen instead of filling out the card"". Now, whoever at Corporate HQ thinks that pushing these frequent diner cards are a good idea needs to have their head checked. It's terribly annoying for customers and I can't imagine the upside is worth annoying a potential return customer with the hard upsell. If servers are incentivized to push this thing, seriously, stop it. We contemplated dessert but our waiter started paying more attention to the table of 10 that walked in next to us. So my son and I had the highlight our of meal, which was sharing a dip code at the nearby DQ.

Caesar salad had a few pieces of limp lettuce, so I didnt ask for 2nds. 1st bowl was the clam chowder. It was one of the better soups at BJs. Pretty good amount of some good-size clams and creamy but not overly creamy soup. Next was tortilla soup. At first, they give you a dry bowl of tortilla chips, avocado and lime. Then they have a secondary container where the pour from to combine the soup with the dry ingredients, right at the table. Pretty cool from a presentation standpoint.

Eric L.,"Oakland, CA",1,24,1,1.0,4/14/2014,"First of all if you have any hopes of getting seated inside be prepared to have to wait 45+ minutes just to be seated. On this occasion we were forced to sit outside on the patio. Upon sitting down on this chilly day, we realized the outdoor heaters were not turned on so we asked our waitress if she could turn them on for us & she quickly mentioned she would get her manager.  This alone struck me off guard since she worked there and should know how to function the heaters on her own for the customers.  I did not want to make a scene to require the manager to personally attend to us for something that could have and should have been done by the server. After finally getting our heater fixed, we ordered our drinks & either the waitress was new or didn't know her stuff but she kept telling us certain things were not on the happy hour menu when we were reading right off of it.  I know it may be a lot to remember but certainly something that should be able to grasp after a while.  STRIKE 1 After finally ordering our drinks, we had to wait a solid 10-15 minutes before getting them served to us which was horrible. The foam on my beer was gone and the evaporation on the glass showed that my beer had been poured a while ago & was sitting on the counter not being delivered to us. Upon receiving my beer, I noticed a little spec of dirt near the top which I had to fork out. At this point, I was pretty dissatisfied but still determined to make this a good experience for my girlfriend & I so I ignored it & drank the beer anyways.  I took a sip of the beer and thanks to the combination of the horrible pour by the bartender and the slow delivery by the server, one small sip equated to nearly an inch of the beer in my glass gone! Ridiculous! It seemed that the servers there were all inexperienced.  Every time one of our dishes was on its way to come out to us, it was as if the server was playing a guessing game.  They would go up to two tables before finally figuring out it was our dish.  I mean how hard could it be to deliver the food the appropriate table number? This is just plain inexcusable, get it together! STRIKE 2 One of the only reasons I decided to go back to this restaurant after my first awful experience of getting cold food was the fact that I had purchased a fundraiser card from our local little league team. Once our ""stellar"" waitress came back to drop off the bill, it turned out she brought us out someone else's bill with OUR discount applied to it. After waiting another 5-10 minutes to flag her down & let her know that she had made a mistake, we finally got the right bill.    Our bill came out to $31 & I reluctantly handed over my credit card to escape this hell hole.  Upon getting my card back I realize that I was charged for $33 dollars instead of the $31 that was on the tab previously.  WHAT TYPE OF RESTAURANT CHANGES A BILLS TOTAL AFTER THE FACT?  STRIKE 3. My girlfriend thought it was ridiculous & suggested to simply not leave a tip, but I didn't want to be rude.  I flagged my waitress down & mentioned it to her & she seemed to have already known of the problem.  If she knew, why hadn't she mentioned it to me!? Apparently the machine was having trouble honoring my discount and ended up charging me the full amount, which would have been nice to know.  Upon the managers arrival he said their machines have been messing up and such.  I did not want to hear this after the fact of my card being charged an amount I hadn't agreed to.  You could tell some of the managers buddies were also in the patio area since he was raising his voice & making a scene out of it.  I did not want to look like the petty guy complaining over a couple dollars but that is exactly what he tried to make me look like.  I was arguing more over the principle of what had happened.  Instead of being relaxed and care free, I was being annoyed. He mentioned, ""oh you want me to log the $1.70 discount? I mean I can easily do that if it will make you happy"" & he chuckled and said it in a way to belittle me in front of his friends.  I eventually started ignoring what he had to say as he didn't seem to get what I was arguing over & I wouldn't be surprised if he was under the influence as well.   I still ended up giving the waitress her tip & paid the tab (without my discount) just so I could leave and not have bad karma laying over me.   To sum it up, the wait staff is inexperienced, the servers are incompetent &  the managers are unprofessional.   The only thing worth anything at this place are the pazookie's which if I ever get the urge to have one it certainly won't be from here. I will gladly drive the extra 30+ miles just to not have to ever lay foot in this specific location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=800

Sean-Paul G.,"San Jose, CA",257,38,30,3.0,7/27/2010,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon round 3.  Joint wasn't too crowded so my buddy and I came in for a bite to eat...you know...get some energy in for the perfect shirt search ahead. We took a seat in the bar area and after a couple minutes, a server came by and handed us menus and took our drink order.  I had an iced tea while my friend had an Arnold Palmer. My iced tea was a little watered down and his Arnold Palmer was waaaay too tart.  Like lip puckering tart.... We were served our meals without silverware or napkins (not that you need silverware for burgers and fries...but you'd think they'd provide it just in case you wanted to cut the burger down more into manageable bites. Had to flag the server down for that... I ordered the Cuban Burger with the wedge cut fries and my friend had the Classic Burger with the crispy thin fries. Our burgers were excellent.  Perfectly cooked...grilled with just a little pink in the middle.  The ham really set my burger off...so yummy. Now onto the fries.... The wedge cut fries were great...each one was crisp and warm....ranch is a great dipper with these suckers. The crispy-thin fries...not so great.  They were a little warm and soggy.  Seems like they were sittin under a heat lamp for quite some time. The server didn't come around as much as we wanted him to...but he was nice and responded to our requests with the quickness. It was an OK experience...but nothing to write home about.... Writing to Yelp it...that's a different story.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=800
Sonya S.,"New Orleans, LA",30,147,94,1.0,12/5/2012,"In fairness, the Beer should get 5 stars, but the food here was so bad, that this place deserves 1 star and they should be ashamed! I have eaten at Bj's in Orlando and Las Vegas and both times had really good food and beer, so we were both shocked that the food here was worse than Mc Donalds- and I HATE fast food! First, my partner ordered the Turkey Burger which came with fries. The fries came out stone cold. When we finally tracked someone down we told them and they eventually brought some more fries, which were also stone cold!! They were obviously from the same batch and had been sitting for some time. Really? Did they not think to check the temp as the issue was the fact that they were inedible cold, not that we wanted piles of fries! Burger was also tasteless, though the roll looked good. I had a Tomato and Mozzarella salad and a thin crust pizza. Pizza actually tasted remarkably like a Tonitos that you buy in the grocery store for .99, but I was paying $10.50. It was obviously frozen and I only ate 2 of the 6 pieces because it was gag worthy. Considering that on occasion I eat Little Cesears $5 Pizza Pizza, my standards  are reasonable. After living in Florida for the past 5 1/2 years, I'm used to blah pizza, believe me! the fact that this was actually inedible really says something. The little salad was OK, though they put overwhelming seasonings on it which kind of ruined it. Just a drizzle of Olive Oil would have been fantastic. I was so annoyed about the food, I refused to get a 2nd beer because they do not deserve any more of my hard earned money! It's a shame because the Red Beer is really tasty. Also the service was horrible. trying to get the attention of a waiter was impossible. My partner joked about tossing his empty beer glass on the floor as they walked by to try and get the attention of someone-anyone! Ugh! Skip this place people, unless you just want beer. The food quality is really, really depressing!

The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars over 2 stars (and really the main reason why I ever go to any BJs) is strictly for the pizookie.  Hot chocoloate chip cookie with some ice cream on top?  TO DIE FOR.  Why can't all restaurants just offer this so I don't have to resort to BJs?  I recently tried the red velvet white chocolate chip pizookie.  Also very good but a little too sweet even for this sweet tooth so I'll still with the classic moving forward. Other positives: beer selection is awesome, there's an abundance of TVs, and their Happy Hour makes it worthwhile (but its only available in the bar area which fills up quickly). I will say, service has always been decent.  Nothing bad to report with that.  Just the food in general is just MEH.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=800

There were maybe 3 current parties in this section, and plenty of 2 or 4 seat tables. We asked if moving ourselves to that list would expedite our wait. One of the hostesses went to check, and said there were several parties on that list and it would take approximately 15 minutes. We thought it was odd, cause it was fairly open, but we decided to keep to our current estimated wait.  25 min later: we asked the hostess where we were on the list. She approximated another 20 minute wait. The boyfriend was too hungry so we decided to find something faster in the mall.

Nobu K.,"San Francisco, CA",1530,966,45,2.0,4/23/2013,"Jim Bean Bourbon Burger, at Carl's Jr. 6 bucks. That's the most great deceptive advertising burger ever as we all know. It just doesn't look like the TV ad, at all. I think Carl's Jr. always does that deceptive TV advertising using fashion model to fool guys around.  A guy like myself.  I am a fool. I really wanted to get the Bourbon Burger, at Carl's Jr. And I did the other day. It was a creepy bad disgusting burger ever had. I believe it was soy-sause mixed w/ high fructose corn syrup plus msg for kick, and calling Bourbon Burger. False Advertising. But, if, you are having a burger is not better than that, that'll be a problem. I had a bacon Cheese burger at BJ's. I was with my friends. My friends like BJ's. I think because those TVs on the wall. I have been avoiding coming here so many times with them but I could not say No to this time. I just did not like the hamburger, OK? The burger patty was dry, not moist at all. It was cold, I hate eating cold burger. I am very sure that my burger was sitting in the kitchen for a while because the place is really big. That is very hard for all wait-staff. We were sitting near by the kitchen so I have heard the commotions from the kitchen and waiters hit the door very hard and came out. That's not good sign seeing and making a bit curious possibly a fight between kitchen staff and waiter, no matter what. All kitchen-staff in any restaurants in California are basically own by Mexicans, right? It's pretty rough in there if you don't speak Spanish. They will tear you down. They'll talk bad behind you back. We all do, don't we? California kitchens are all rough world. But, they should keep their problem more quietly in the kitchen. I felt bad for the waitstaff because our waitress was good. They must have a bigass kitchen, many people working really hard, but a big restaurant like this, I don not know how to manage people, how to control orders and who gets 1st, and what not. So, I do feel sorry giving the place 2 star. But, Hey, my hamburger was not that good. Bourbon Burger at Carl's   better. So, I still try to avoid the place.

First server was very nice but left us to another server. She was nice, busy and could do better in making is feel welcome to her section. We ordered. We waited for the whole party to join us than order so more. She didn't ring up our food up until we are all ready as a whole group. Finally we waited. Got our drinks, food and appetizers. THE FOOD RUNNER was absolutely rude. ""I have a pizza"" stares at us with a mad face making us feel we order something wrong. Simply made the mood of party a bummer. I let it go but my party was upset for the rude service. He comes back with more food and just stands there waiting for us to grab it and pass  it down the long table. he goes ""I have a bunch of pizookies"" glares at us with an angry with the ""I don't like my job look"". I get upset and so does my party. Our server is trying her best to accommodate us but I felt she rushed us and could of gave us a better service but her efforts were there even though there was ALOT of mistakes. But this review is for the food runner. The overall tone was set when he rudely came up to our table. I took matters in my hand and asked for the manager. Great Guy!!! Heard me out and I explained to him our problem and overall experience. He apologize and was able to comp out desert. Overall I wanted to leave the store and let the manager know the situation.

I understand that we went during a playoff game and it gets super busy but that is no excuse for good customer service. Second of all, they had a shortage of glasses and pitchers and asked us to chug our beers so they could use our glasses. Although I agree that beers should be chugged and not sitting on the table waiting to be consumed, it's kind of rude to ask us to drink all our beers so you could use our glasses. If a customer wants to take their time with their drink, then allow them to do so. It's not our faults that you aren't prepared enough to provide glasses for customers to drink their beers especially since this is a popular place that allows customers to watch sports especially during big NBA playoff games with a Bay Area team playing. Oh and did I mention that another server came to our table and told us to pour the rest of what's in the pitcher into our glasses.  Third of all, the server we had was not nice at all. She never came to our table and asked if we needed anything else or if we were doing okay. When we asked for a beer menu she kept walking away as she agreed to get it for us. And then just dropped it off at our table without acknowledging us or being polite about it. AND all of a sudden we had a different waitress. Nobody informed us whether the first server we had was going on a break or not. We had to find out by seeing her picking at her teeth with her finger nails.  Fourth and foremost, they took away my salad that I didn't finish. They didn't ask if I was finished or if I wanted to take it home. There was still plenty left to eat and it irks me to know that they took it and didn't even dare to ask me if I was still eating it.  One of the worst services I have ever experienced.

I was told that the hostesses were busy, so whoever answered the phone would check himself. Let me put it out there now..I WAS ON THE PHONE FOR 16 MINUTES!!!! ( ) I'm a pretty patient person to wait that long, but 16 MINUTES just to see what our wait is?! & I got PUT ON HOLD THREE TIMES & had to ASK THE SAME THING TWICE. Also..I came to find out THAT I WASN'T EVEN PUT ON THE LIST IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!! What's the point of having a call-ahead service?!!? I don't care that it's a busy Friday night..if you're going to advertise the call-ahead option, GO BY IT & PUT PEOPLE DOWN!!! I was so fed up on the 3rd hold that I just hung up & WE TOOK OUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!! Way to bring down the mood. I was in a really good mood..hence the MINI-CELEBRATORY DINNER...but yes BJ's, YOU RUINED IT!!  Who makes a customer wait 16 MINUTES..actually MORE than that since I got so fed up that I hung up. I don't know anyone else who'd wait on hold for 16 minutes for ANY business. That's just ridiculous. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE..even over the phone. I have yet to go back & not really sure if I even want to anymore. The service keeps getting worse & I'm not even sure that it's worth it. Maybe the drive to another location is more worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=840

I can't recall ever having such good food from a restaurant chain before. Take note Fridays and Ruby Tuesdays, should a BJs open on your block! As for the Oasis Amber it hit the right sultry amber note with a moderate to heavy touch of carbonation; perfect for washing down a burger, pizza or in my case, an amazing chicken club. Service at the bar was friendly and professional, complete with the witty banter that makes the bar experience better than a lonely table.

Nellie N.,"Daly City, CA",0,42,1,2.0,12/4/2012,"BJ's is always crowded, one would hope this is because of the quality food, unfortunately there must be other reasons, as the food is consistently disappointing and orders are routinely missing requested options such as ""dressing on the side"" resulting in a salad smothered in dressing. Pros - -brewed beer -lots of HDTVs -location -options on the menu Cons - - Woefully under-staffed take-out area -orders are incorrect 80% of the time (missing sauce, items, side orders etc..) -food is highly processed typical frozen/pre-made chain food -so many items on the menu, but only a few are half decent -management unable to provide direction to army of kids doing the work -cooks/food prep lack skill and direction.   Everything is microwaved/salty/fried -bagged / pre-chopped lettuce  -long waits for take out or seating  -potential gold mine location is mismanaged  as some staff stand around with nothing to do while others are overwhelmed and backed up as orders sit and get cold For a chain restaurant, BJ's would receive high marks.  It's certainly much better than Applebees, or Olive Garden, they brew their own beer, and have a wide variety of items that are a bit more modern than the fare at Applebees. The main problem is many of the ingredients are clearly ""pre-prepped"" items.  This is standard for many chain restaurants and unfortunately even local places take this short cut.  For instance the salad uses chopped iceberg lettuce and pre-made boiled eggs.   I suspect the lettuce is cut and bagged, the reason I suspect this is because of how dry it often is and many times there is a lot of browning around the edges of the chopped area. The chicken fingers on top of the salad are clearly pre-cooked, frozen variety, Safeway frozen food section quality.  Is it really that hard to use fresh chicken on a salad?  Apparently this is a money/time saver.   It's very simple to make your own breaded chicken breast, it's borderline insulting to use frozen/pre-made and then sell it on a restaurant menu. Probably the best items I've had from BJs are the ""small bites""  fried artichokes and chicken wontons.   While these also taste pre-made/frozen, it's the type of food that holds up ok to being processed.  Dipping fried wontons in hot sauce and blue cheese is a classic experience that is difficult to mess up. But BJ's has managed to mess it up by routinely forgetting to include the blue cheese with to-go orders. The take-out section is woefully understaffed.  Usually by 1 or 2 very young kid is tasked with handling the ever-ringing phone, walk in orders, and bagging and sorting it all.   Meanwhile a middle aged manager usually roams around pointing and making conversation with seated guests.  At the hostess area, a group of young kids usually stands there aimlessly and making small talk with each other while the take-out area is 5 orders deep, and having difficulty arranging it all. You have to wonder if BJs management cares at all what anyone thinks.  They are constantly crowded, and consider it's much better food than the nearby ""Hooters"" you have to assume that ""good enough"" is all they are concerned with. Truthfully, if you are in the Tan-Foran mall, what else are you going to do?  Hooters, Food Court, Red Robin are your options.   All of them poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=820

Ashley M.,"Eugene, OR",545,461,940,4.0,7/8/2012,"I came into BJ's on a Thursday afternoon with my brother to grab some lunch. This place is huge! Many tables inside, a few outside, and even some in the mall where BJ's is attached. The staff greeted us kindly and we were seated immediately. The place was busy but not packed and soon I was sippin' on a watermelon mojito (one of their signature drinks). The mojito was alright, all I could really taste was the Watermelon Puckers they pour into it but I knew I was chancing it with something that was watermelon flavored in the first place. My brother works at a BJ's in Sonoma County so he knew what to order and what to not order. We had the potato skin appetizers and the California club flat bread. Both were tasty in an artery clogging sort of way. I had a few bites of each and man did I feel 10 pounds heavier. We packaged up most of it for the people back home and ordered our main course. The ahi tuna salad was giant and satisfying. I asked for no bell peppers and Voilà! No red bell peppers!...(I swear every time I ask for that no one can handle it). When I saw the tiny drops of wasabi around my plate I thought I'd have to order more but I was wrong. The wasabi is SOOOOO SPICY! I can handle a good amount with my sushi at most authentic Japanese restaurants and eat more than the average person but this stuff was lethal. I liked it.  My brother had the crispy chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. The potatoes are really cheesy but yummy none the less. We were stuffed but decided to share a mini Oreo Cookie Pazooki. It's a scoop of Oreo Cookie ice cream on a chocolate cookie with oreo cookie mousse on the side. It was the perfect small size for a few bites...unlike the table next to us ordering the 7 scoop, giant cookie party Pazooki! Damn!

Shrimp scampi was the most disappointing of all. I looked at it and knew it wasn't going to be good and i was right. It was flavorless. Everything looks better pictured in the menu.

It can also get pretty windy and cold out on the patio, and the outdoor heaters aren't too effective against the wind. Thankfully, the patio does have clear walls that help retain the heat just a bit. Anyways, onto the food! I absolutely loved the angel hair pasta dish, and the flatbreads are good too.

I got a side salad....it was mostly white iceberg lettuce, very little green, and what was green was very light green.  Then the shrimp tacos.  The tacos were decent, but it came with tortilla chips, a small ramekin of salsa and one of a creamy avacado sauce.  Well the chips were greasy, which was unappetizing.  We all know chips are made by deep frying but they don't usually come out and stay shiny and wet with grease.  Then the ramekins were so small, you couldn't dip your chip into the salsa or sauce.  That defeats the use of chips.  Just dumb decision by the restaurant.

Server kept saying the food would come out soon but it never did. She said she let the manager know already, but it seemed like the manager didn't do anything about it since it was 30 minutes ago since she told him and the food was still not out. I could have understood if the place was busy-- but it wasnt. Then when my food came out, it was incomplete. But she insisted that everything was there. But when i looked around-- the vegetables were missing. So i asked for the manager-- which took 15 minutes. When the manager, Spencer, came out, he said, ""So I understand your food took too long to come out? Just for future references-- it should not take more than 8-10 minutes for a steak salad."" He then apologized but just took my plate away. He made sure i didnt think the server forgot to ring in my food--but the way he said it made it seem like he was covering for her.  OKAY SIR. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.. you and your staff should take note of that and you should have intervened ASAP once the server told you it was taking forever. And as a manager, you should have personally checked in with me... and explained instead of waiting for ME to ask for you.  anyways--didnt feel like ordering anything else. lost my appetite.  this place is only good if you want to get drinks at the bar and make use of their TV. other than that-- service sucks. food takes forever.

James D.,"San Francisco, CA",64,44,3,1.0,10/12/2012,"I used to really enjoy going to BJs because they had decently priced food and drinks but sadly I gotta say they've gone downhill in recent years. The food quality was never top notch to begin with (though that's kinda expected) but sanitation has become an increasing problem in my recent visits. I had ordered a mini pizza and as I began digging in I noticed an incredibly long hair baked into my pizza. I was offered a new pizza but I declined and the manager actually came to apologize. I didn't get anything complimentary but he removed the pizza from my bill so I didn't stress the issue. Fast forward to today and I am being served by someone who I'm assuming is a nice lady but was either trained improperly or does not seem to understand how to read the menu. For starters we were told we weren't allowed to get a specific soup because it was neither a Wedneday or Saturday which apparently are the only days the soup is available. Upon looking at the menu it listed that the soup was ""Served Wednesday-Saturday"" and when we brought it up to the waitress she said that it was only for those two specific days listed. WHAT?!?! The last straw came with our bill. We ordered the lunch size pasta which comes with a soup or salad and is $1 off the regular price. My GF substituted the Shrimp for her meal bringing the regular price up about $1 and it was listed clearly that the total should be $13.95. Let's do simple math here: $13.95 - $1 because of the lunch special = what? If you said $12.95 you are wrong because it's actually $15+. When I addressed the error she took it to her supervisor and came back stating that I was wrong and even after pointing out the errors on their part she continued to insist they were right. Finally after some back and forth she came back with the ""corrected"" price of $13.05 and I realized that it would be a waste of time to wait for them to get the correct price of $12.95 so I paid the extra dime.  I won't be coming back here for awhile and if you read this far, you may wanna stay away too. There are great servers here but the bad apples spoiled the bunch for me. Btw, even though our waitress (I won't say names) checked up on us maybe once every 15 mins, once I was supposed to sign the bill and leave a tip she decided to check up on me every 2 mins.

We had the Mediterranean pizza, 1 order of the wings, kids spaghetti with marinara sauce and kids chicken tenders. As soon as we arrived (~15 min after calling in) we were greeted by the take-out cashier, we paid for our food and went on our way. Opening the pizza box, to my dismay, was a pizza that looked very different than the ones I had ordered from there before. Quality was lacking; toppings were clumped together or spread unevenly, the edges had no form and lacked the crispiness they once had, and the pizza was barely cut. The actual key ingredients such as the chicken, were almost nowhere to be found!!! We ordered a large pizza and i could fit all of the chicken into the palm of my hand.... The wings had gotten worse as well, they tasted less like chicken and more like the fryer oil they are to be cooked in.

Shannon T.,"South San Francisco, CA",228,54,5,1.0,11/28/2013,"I read the negative reviews on Yelp before going to BJ's yesterday afternoon for lunch with a friend and her 2 kids (both under the age of 4)... I was disgusted! We sat for over 25 minutes before having to wave down a waiter to take our order and then waited another 30 minutes for it to come... In the meantime, a few of the runners delivered her son his ""mini sliders"" meal. He picked up one to begin eating and they then realized that they had brought the order to the wrong table. They took the plate back and we watched them bring it to another incorrect table before finding the correct one. I had to go and find a booster seat myself and felt the customer service was awful! I felt bad for our waiter because it was not his fault... This place is disorganized and completely unprepared for big crowds which I would imagine happens daily...

Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,4.0,11/20/2010,"B.J.'s has done something wonderful and horrible to their menus. They've added calorie counts (GASP! ACK! COVER YOUR EYES!) 8^O Yes, either I had selective inattention to the plainly printed calorie counts (both per slice or per dish--except for drinks) or they have recently begun to add this for the benefit of their chubby clientele.  From their website FAQ's: ""At this time BJ's Restaurants provides nutritional information for each menu item in California and Oregon.""   This actually made it harder to order than normal because now you are  painfully AWARE of the caloric damage that a BJ's Cuban burger (Calories: 1,249 (but also not in the menu: Fat: 73g, Carbs: 37g, 104g Protein)) or even their ""healthy"" Sesame Chicken Salad (950 calories) per salad, have LOTs more calories than you think you are getting as a single serving. With these subtle warnings in hand, we settled for healthier, lower calorie options [Appetizers comprised our dinner: really good California flat-bread and excellent BBQ pork sliders] but it really opens your eyes that even a mini pizza, and most of their dinner menu items, have enough calories (1,000 +- 100) to split, unless you like splitting your pants.  Service was excellent this time but this is not a consistent quality at this BJs. I did appreciate their call-ahead feature: you can call in ahead of your actual arrival, thus giving you a waiting place in line, so it shortens your actual waiting time there. Enjoy the more informative  BJ's menu! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=860

I guess most families will not go to Hooters which is why they are all here. Go to the food court if you must eat inside the mall.   On a Friday night, we've waited 1hr 45mins for our table and we sat in one of the booth. Since we had movie tickets, we wanted to be sure we can get out of there on time. Service was slow and our server did not check on us at all. We need them to run our credit cards so that we can get outta there so we waved down another server. This rude guy refused to take it but then finally took it with an upset and annoyed look.  We've ordered majorly fried food entrees thinking you can't mess that up. Boy we were wrong, they tasted they were fried while they were still frozen, it has no flavor, completely over-fried and very salty. I ordered fried shrimp and I would've guess I ate fried plastic.  The cheese on their pizza chews and tastes like rubber. Is that industrial grade chhese? Gross.  The appitizer sampler was $16 and came with very little food.

I ordered the Texas Style Chicken Fried Steak ($12.25).  It came with steamed veggies and cheddar mashed potatoes.  The steaks were a bit on the chewy side...could have used a pounding or 2 with a tenderizer.  The cream sauce was peppery and had a could texture.  The veggies were a bit blend, but they were fresh and not frozen, thank goodness.  Just dip the veggies into some of the cream sauce.  The cheddar mashed potatoes was very cheesy...really awesome and highly recommended.  Just a side note, you get 2 pieces of steak with this order.  The steaks were in the fryer a bit too long, coming out a bit on the dark brown side.  The batter used reminded me KFC chicken...I think the Colonel might have been moonlighting. I did taste the below items: Chicken Pesto Flat Bread Pizza - not bad, good texture.  The pesto was garlicky and gave the pizza a really good finish. Deep Dish Cheese Pizza - the bready crust was awesome,  but the sauce was nothing to write home about. Pizookie- this is a fresh chocolate chip cookie cooked in a small deep dish pan topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The cookie was good, the chips were warm and melty.  The vanilla ice cream was ... just vanilla...plain and without a bang...boring. Now for the restroom report - I went to the restroom 2 times about an hour apart.  The restroom had 2 sitters and 2 standees.  The floors near the urinals were wet and smelled of urine...the floors were sticky.  If I dropped a $100 bill on the floor in the Men's Room...I would probably just leave it.  The trash cans were full and needed emptying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=860

Now for the longest run-on sentence of your life: I've tried the Spinach and Artichoke Dip (tasty, but I wish it came with bread), Avocado Egg Rolls (good), Original Roast Beef Dip Sandwich (solid and filling), BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich (tasty but too much bun), Buffalo Chicken Pizza (flavor is good but I'm not a fan of deep dish), Spaghetti with Spicy Tomato Sauce (I add chicken), New Orleans Jambalaya (huge portion but it's a little dry), Miso Salmon (the citrus glaze is crazy sweet, blech), Old-Fashioned Pot Roast (the portion could stand to be a little bigger). If your meal comes with fries, the wedges can't be missed. You know what used to taste awesome but was unceremoniously removed from the menu? The meatloaf. WHY? WHY DID YOU TAKE IT OFF THE MENU?! (A server actually told me a man became so angry it disappeared he yelled at the restaurant in general, slammed his menu on the table and stormed out. That's how good it was.) Atmosphere is typically semi-dark and bustling. Food is sorta pricey but usually portions are big. The servers are pretty on point about asking if you need help and bringing you extra stuff you ask for (aka Tabasco, more ranch, etc.). Waits can be horrendous, especially Fri-Sun when parents bring their six kids. I'll always find it strange going to places where there are giggling kids at one table and yelling single drunk chicks literally 10 ft. away. I really wish they would let me rate places half stars because I think this place is a solid 3.5.

Also got the artichoke and spinach dip ($2 off) that came out hot and gooey and big enough to share with many people. Also got 3 mini pizzas (half off)- vegetarian, 3 meat, white pizza. Each incredibly good in their own way; cooked to perfection and just enough cheese. Deep dish always has a place in my stomach.  One thing to note that is if you go to happy hour, it's free seating at the bar. I love how our waitress didn't even know that after we asked her. Also, service is basically non-existant.

Yea, it's so simple but so amazing at the same time.  Not to mention, the portions are big enough to share so order something different.  Last time I came here, I had sliders, a pizza, and the avocado rolls.  OMG LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE AVOCADO EGG ROLLS ARE AWESOME.  I love the dipping sauce that it comes with!  Honestly, what takes away the stars is always the service.  I just feel like for the amount of people I see working there, it shouldn't take as long as it does to get the food and even just water.  When you have to ASK for your water instead of your waiter/waitress asking you what you'd like to drink -- that's already a minus for me, baby.  If the wait is long, there's barnes and noble right across and the mall's right there if you want to shop around as well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=860

So while we were waiting we ordered a total of 3 rounds of shots and some apps. Finally my other 2 friends showed up at 6:30pm so we ordered 7 more shots-almost a double shot per person and some cocktails. Since HH ends at 7pm we squeezed in 3 more shots. That's a total of 16 shots among 4 of us.  It may sound like a lot but trust me it wasn't.  They totally skimp on the shots..it's about 50% less than what other places would normally serve. That's why we had to double it up.   Right when we received all our drinks and our food and was getting ready to dig in and ENJOY our Friday, a manager named Cacy came over to us and starts asking us if we were ""OK"" and if we needed anything else.  We told him everything was good...but yet he still lingered at our table and gave us this weird vibe. We can tell his intentions were not simply just checking in on his customers. So finally I asked...""are you kicking us out?"" He replied ""No, but I won't be able to serve you guys any more drinks.""  WHAT?!!  We all just looked at each other in shock. Did we just get cutoff for the night??? At 7:05pm??? Yes we did!! His explanation was because we ordered too much within the last hour and he's concerned for our safety.  We told him that we've been here since 5pm...Almost half of it was ordered during that time and the last round we doubled it up because HH was ending.  Our drinks were still on the table. He can clearly see that. Furthermore, we were not loud or rowdy at all.  In fact the group next to us at the bar was pounding shots left n right, breaking glasses, and extremely loud but I'm positive that they did not get cut off.  What kind of BS is this? He totally offended and targeted us! Ok I can understand that you have your policies to abide by, but why not wait until we order the next round and then inform us of your ""cutoff"" policy.  Why do it RIGHT AFTER we received our drinks and food? How do you expect us as customers to be able to enjoy our dining experience?? This was just absolutely Ridiculous. We were so pissed it's not even funny.

The avocado egg rolls, deep dish pizzas, and pizookies with a cold beer makes up a typical yet fulfilling BJ's meal. You really can't go wrong with that combo.

Leanne K.,"San Francisco, CA",269,79,1192,3.0,1/17/2010,"I've been here since it first opened when they were giving out free meals to train their wait staff. All the waiters have changed and I think they need another training session. That's probably the worst part about it, some of the staff are just rude, I don't need someone to be passive-aggressive. It's almost like there's too much going on, they are overloaded and they don't care anymore either.  The line, the wait to actually sit down is horrible. Be ready to wait an hour or longer. Yesterday we got there at 5:25pm, sat at 6:10pm. We thought 5:25 was early, we kind of beat the rush that came after us. Even if you aren't hungry, go early you'll still have to wait, by the time you sit you'll be starving. TIP: get a pager and stand by the bar if your party is willing to sit there, they have a row of cushioned seats and tall tables that you can sit at. If you see a party almost done, go stand next to that table and SWOOP once they get out from their seats. It's brutal. You don't have to wait to be seated if you sit there. Then give the pager back and say you found a seat at the bar. Then you're covered just in case. Ok, now to the food. I had their New BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich which was really good. When i first saw it, it was covered in beer battered onion rings, I was thinking, ""where's the pork?"" It was there, good flavor and it's big. Served with a fresh coleslaw and either wedge-cut or skinny fries.  Sister got my usual, the Angel Hair Toscana with chicken (or shrimp). The pasta is good here. if you aren't in to oil, don't order pasta, it's very shiny, if you know what I mean. Very big portions so come ready to eat. Friends got the Jambalaya and the Cajun Pasta. Friend said the Jambalaya was too salty. From the bite that I took, it was eh, nothing popped in my mouth. The Cajun pasta was very shiny but my friend wasn't  impressed. After awhile he thought it was too spicy. Depending on your tolerance for spicy food. Oh the handcrafted root beer here is good. It's not so carbonated and you get free refills. If you like carbonation this isn't the drink for you. If you want beer but you can't choose from their selection, just get the sampler, you get to try everything (I think 6), about 6 oz or more of each. It might be a lot so if you have friends, share with them. In the end we ordered the Trio Pizookie. Three mini pizookies so we could try the flavors. We got the Chocolate Chunk, White Macadamia, and the Triple Ghiradelli Chocolate. After eating all the food before I'm glad we ordered the minis. Between 5 of us that was good for us, but it depends on how much your party wants, if you're still not full and you love desserts get the regular size or share the party platter (HUGE).  I always come back, but not that often, but if you want to watch a sports game or just hang out at the bar, it's a fun place. It's pretty loud in there too, so be aware if you wanted something more intimate, this isn't your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=920

Tired from traveling I did not want this to take very long.  Drink and food came in a reasonable amount of time but my baked potato was cold. Hungry and tired I just ate. I noticed that the table next to mine sent several items back that were either cold or undercooked. I then waiting almost 20 min after I was done to get my check. I gave the waiter my card right away. Once I did it took another 10 min for him to bring the bill back for me to sign. At this point I just wanted to leave. In my haste, I walked off and left my sunglasses. Today I called around noon to see if I could pick them up. I called and was put on hold for nearly 20 min. Finally I hung up. I called back an hour or so later only to get put on hold again for 10 min this time. When I finally did get a response I was told that no my glasses were not found. I told them that I left them there and they should be in a lost and found. Nope. No such thing. No care or concern whatsoever that I lost them in that restaurant. I know I left them on the table so they should be there for me to retrieve. Am I wrong in this? I am disappointed at the amount of time I wasted last night, poor service, cold food, and people that just obviously don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=920
Dessert F.,"San Jose, CA",2,16,,1.0,1/19/2014,Recently moved to the area and went to BJs a few times within the first month. Our dine in experiences were pretty good but takeout experiences have been terrible!! Food for two people took a full hour longer than quoted over the phone.  Order was incomplete for 30 minutes while they waited for a side of steamed veggies. Staff were polite but were clearly overwhelmed because the 3 orders around me were also incorrect. It appears communication between the staff is lacking and all they offered me was a soda while I waited. And that came after I'd been standing there for a hour beyond the expected pickup time. We'll eat at any of the other local restaurants before returning.  Oh and avoid the berry cobbler. It looks and tastes like it came from an easy bake oven.

Carolyn S.,"New York, NY",2,12,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Came here on a Sunday at 5 and the initial interaction with the hostesses who ignored my brother to finish a conversation among themselves for several minutes shoould have been our first clue to not bother- but we ate here anyway.  We order food for 3 adults and 1 child.  The food comes for the three adults- but not the child.  My salad had a huge hair on it, so I immediately send it back with the same person who brought it over.  Fast forward 10 minutes- no waitress and no food for myself or my nephew.  I ask a waiter to go get our waitress. he returns a couple minutes later and asks what her name is. She never said, so we did not know, but cant you figure that out? She finally comes over- still with no food- and no apology or explanation. I ask for a manager. A woman walks over and is very nice and says she will go check. She walks away and doesnt come back.  Now a soup that was also missing arrives- still no salad sans hair, and no kids meal.  The missing food finally comes (its been about 20 minutes and the other two adults are basically done eating).  Another manager comes over and apologizes, gets us more water (we had needed water for a majority of this time) and makes adjustments to the check while promising our server will be attentive to us the rest of the meal. he was very nice and I appreciated his apology and check adjustment.  However the waitress did not come back, and when it was time for the check a waiter comes over and says she has gone on break but he will get the check.  Really?? The food was decent but certainly not worth the hassle.  As much fun as it is to make a two year old wait for his food for 20 minutes after his parents both have food and to receive a salad with hair in it, Ill pass next time and take my business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=920

Lily W.,"San Francisco, CA",128,9,,3.0,10/24/2013,"I came here twice in one week because of a Google Offer deal that offers a 3 course meal for 2 for $19.95. (It's still going on. Expires: Nov. 11. 2013) The 3 courses include your choice of soup/salad, medium pizza, and a pizookie! What a steal!  First time: Although I wasn't really in the mood for pizza, I was excited to eat at BJ's for the first time because I have been wanting to try the much raved about pizookie. My verdict after the meal: it was just....ok. FOOD: Soups: Clam chowder and Mexican tortilla. Before I mention taste...why was my soup lukewarm? It should be hot! On to taste:Clam chowder was tasty and had nice chunks of clams. Mexican tortilla was too salty.  Pizza: Deep dish BBQ Ranch chicken. I don't like dip dish, but the pizza was pretty good.I actually wouldn't even call it deep dish, because it was more of a thick bread with a semi-thick topping.  Pizookie: Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top. I can see why people like it because it was tasty, but it was way too sweet for me. I couldn't finish it.  DRINKS: Beer: 8 samplers, including the seasonal pumpkin flavored beer. They make their own beer! My favorite was the oasis and blondie, while my sister liked the piranha.  SERVICE: Where is my water??? My server seemed to have forgotten to bring my table water, so I asked the next server walking by for some water. He jokingly commented: ""So you must be thirsty"" before leaving to get my water ""Uhhh, yeah I'm thirsty. I have been sitting here for over 10 minutes without water"" is what I said in my head. He came back with ONE cup of water while my sister sitting across from me eyed me with disbelief. You're kidding me, right?! Another thing is that the waiter forgot to bring our to-go boxes after our meal. He only brought our boxes over after he saw my sister eyeing him with boxes in hand for another table while walking by.  Despite the mediocre service and food, I went back two days later with my sister and parents because it's still a good deal! The second time around, the food was still mediocre but the service was much better. Our server was very attentive despite making some mistakes. She gave us the wrong order. We ordered the BBQ chicken hand-tossed pizza and realized it was the buffalo chicken pizza after taking a bite, but we decided to keep it anyway since we already took a big chunk from the pizza. She also forgot to apply the discount at the end, but she realized her mistake before I spoke when she saw my phone in hand and apologized for it. We forgave her for her mistakes because our food came in a timely manner, she made sure we were enjoying our food and cleaned up the extra plates taking up space on the table without asking. As for the food that day, there isn't much to add, except to GET THE CRISPY POTATO SKINS!! I A bit pricey for an appetizer, but I loveee potatoes and these were perfect!   Overall, I probably will come here only when there is a deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=920

My experience with the food and customer service was excellent. Our waiter, Leo, was very patient and friendly. He smiled all the time and for the most part, he made sure that all of our concerns were taken care of. For example, we were worried because the pasta did not come out after about 30 minutes, however our pizza was already out. He made sure that the pasta came out and got to us. I admired him a lot because he had to tolerate my aunt who complained about the salad and mostly everything, which I give him props to. The deep dish pizza (BBQ chicken) was tasty as usual and the pasta (ravioli) was also good. By the end of this experience, I was pretty full, but as usual, we had to order the pizookie. The pizookie the best part of the whole food experience. The wonderful warm feeling of that awesome buttery cookie was just so yummy and delicious that it made my taste buds explode (not literally).

The food tales a while to come out from the kitchen so if you're extremely hungry, order an appetizer. I recommend the brushetta.

I mean I just ordered it straight off the menu so I guess it was the expeditors fault for not looking at what they were grabbing off the line. So I was patient, it's very important to be patient! =) So it came back with a few more ingredients but still not as the menu has it being prepared. It was a bummer but after mentioning it to Larissa she quickly explained it to the manager who then quickly came to our table to express his apologies for the mix-up.

I was planning on getting the pizookie but I guess I'm not. So many waiters have come and gone and not one of them asks us if we want the bill or if we want to order dessert. We saw many of the other waiters check up on their tables but we were totally ignored. We didn't even know where our waiter went. We've definitely had better service before. Would we come back?

By far the most worst promotional item I have ever seen and eaten at a chain restaurant.  You know it's bad when you think the check would be the fastest thing to get back, but even that took another 10 minutes after I raised my hand like I was in school.

Paul O.,"San Jose, CA",3,18,,1.0,1/17/2014,"This individual BJ's is by far the absolute worst franchised resturant/bar that I have ever been to. If you are the manager, supervisor, or owner of this place - please keep reading this review, and know that you should never EVER think that you are running your business well.  EVERY PART OF THE EXPERIENCE AT THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE. My girlfriend and I went here just last night, around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. It wasn't busy, there was no line waiting for seats, and there were open tables through the resturant. We chose to sit at the bar area, at one of the two-top tall tables, in order to get served a little more rapidly, as well as get drinks quicker. We sat, and sat, and sat, and waited, and watched as many waiters, waitresses, bussers, and pretty much everyone walked by our table. No one said anything to us about being right with us, offering us water, menu's, drinks, nothing. Even the bartender, who was not more than four feet away from us, who was staring right at us, NEVER asked us if we needed or wanted anything. It was seriously about 10 mins before our waitress came up to our table with menus - and no I'm not exaggerating, the basketball game was on, we were watching it, and the full commercial breaks,and more game, and more commercials, while waiting for service... When our waitress came she was very nice - this was the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS RESTURANT. She took our drink order - my girl got some pink cadillac cocktail, and I simply ordered a dirty martini. We also asked for the fried calamari appetizer, and we'd continue looking at the menu. When the drinks came, I sipped mine and immediately knew that someone screwed it up. I'm going to tell you something that may come as a shock - a martini is made with GIN... NOT VODKA. If I ordered a vodka martini, then I'd want vodka in it. When someone orderes a martini - that means GIN. Now, I understand that some people who order drinks may not know that, so it is up to the servers and barkeeps to specify gin or vodka if they think the person ordering it might be too stupid to know what is in a real martini. Also on the martini, a dirty martini means that you add some olive juice to the gin and vermouth as well, not just THREE OLIVES in the glass. (In case you were wondering, yes three olives is excessive for a martini) Now on to the calamari which came shortly after the drinks. They were overly fried (almost burned), and not seasoned with salt at all. In fact, the breading on it was so bland it made flour look spicy. The two dipping sauces which come with calamari are supposed to be tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Guess what we were given!! MOTHERFUCKING RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE.  Let me re-iterate that for you: RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE INSTEAD OF TARTAR AND COCKTAIL SAUCE. What kind of stupid ass, dumb fucks do you have plating in that kitchen? Next up our meal came. We ordered a buffalo burger and the ahi salad. When we ordered it, we asked for an extra plate so that we could split the two in half and share them. No extra plate came with our food. The dipshit that brought us the food asked us if we needed anything else, I asked for some horseradish dipping sauce, or something similar. He said no problem. He never came back. With no extra plate, I scraped the crap-salad off the plate with the burger onto a different, dirty plate (more on that later), and we made do with the rest. The burger was mediocre at best. There was very littly ""buffalo"" sauce on the burger, only a sliver of onion on it, and a single leaf of lettuce. The patty looked like a pre-packaged patty that you tear the paper off and slap on the grill when you don't care about quality. In all, the burger was sub-par. The salad, which should have been stupid simple was also screwed up. The ahi, which should have had a brief sear on it, was overly seared, though at least seasoned well. What completely ruined this plate was the wasabi paste on it. Now, I can handle spice - and I love wasabi. This shit was so in-edible, that you even put a small bit on the ahi, and you are tearing up. It ruined everything that it touched. Which was awesome, because some bites of sald would not have any on it (which was nice) and others would send me looking for my non-existent water glass. Which, btw, there was no water glass. Oh, and the shit cocktails were empty just after starting the meal. Nice, huh? The kicker of all this, was the dirty ass tables directly next to us. They were piled with trash, and dirty dishes the ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE. They didn't start bussing them until we were leaving - don't forget that this place WAS NOT BUSY! NO EXCUSE FOR THIS. This whole experience only cost me a little over sixty dollars.  I'd like to extend a very healthy FUCK YOU to the management team and owners of this establishment for allowing this kind of stupidity and complete lack of service that we got. I hope you loose money, and go out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=900

Katie W.,"San Francisco, CA",48,14,,2.0,2/16/2013,"Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse used to be a lot better; however, in the last few months, it seems they have dropped the ball in the service department. First off, I do love the actual facility as far as set-up, decor, and atmosphere.  It always seems to be packed with patrons and the hosts at the front are friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, the service here has gotten pretty crappy lately.  My go to items to order are the California Club pizza & the Red Velvet Pazzokie.  Both are usually great.  My fiancé and I have eaten there/ordered food from there maybe 4 times in the last 3 months.  The last time I ordered the California club pizza there was extra flour caked onto the bottom of my pizza, it was gross.  Service was alright.   3rd to last time we were in there was the worst.  We dinned in at the Brewhouse this night.  It took 5 minutes for us to even be greeted by our server, who then disappeared for an additional 5 minutes without even taking our drink order.  After sitting there for 15+ minutes, we finally ordered drinks.  My fiancé ordered a steak and I ordered shrimp kabobs and a lobster tail.  When our food arrived, mine was cold.  Now I've been a server at numerous restaurants and I know how tough the job is, and it takes a lot for me to actually complain about something.  This is the first time I have ever actually had to ask the waitress to take my food back to be warmed up.  My fiancé was nearly finished with his food before I got to begin eating mine.  Thats just not acceptable when you're spending $80+ on a dinner at BJ's (which is a lot for this place).  We clearly weren't a priority on this night. 2nd to last time, was mid december of 2012.  We ordered the curbside take-out for the first time.  It was simple enough to order online and the wait time wasn't too long.  We ordered a personal pizza, the meatball app., and the gormet Mac n' cheese.  I was very disappointed with the mac n' cheese.  The bacon in the mac n' cheese was burnt to a black crisp.  It tasted disgusting!  The worst part, is that someone clearly didn't care that they were putting charcoal into my dinner...  I tried to pick out as much of the bacon as I could and tried to eat around it. The last time we ordered food was Feb. 14th, 2013.  We ordered the curbside take out again online.  We ordered about $45+ of food, including one of their baked potatoes.  When my fiancé went to pick up the food about 40 minutes later, he arrived to find out they had no potatoes left.  They had made the rest of the food; however, never called to inform us that we needed to choose a substitute, so I didn't get dinner.  My dinner ended up being the pizookie, they gave us for free (which we had already ordered) to make up for it.  There is no excuse for not calling to get a substitute choice, for 40 minutes!   Seems as though this place may have a high turn-over rate of servers.  Whatever the problem is, I'm to the point where I'm simply going to go over to Jack's for dinner.  They have never gotten our orders wrong, left us sitting at the table with no greeting, and the food is always great & also affordable!  BJ's needs to step up their game, they are displaying a message of ""We are trying to accomodate for more patrons than we can handle, so some may suffer.""  Not worth it to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=900

It was a little crowded which I expected for a Sunday evening so we had about a 20 minute wait time to be seated which was not bad. Everything from that point was downhill. We ordered an appetizer and each ordered a small pizza we waited for about 35 minutes when a manager came out and told us that the pizzas were all taking about 20 minutes longer than normal. So, we waited. Our server hardly came to check on us and when she did we felt very rushed to finish our food. She kept asking us about dessert before we were done eating our food. The Pepsi that we had was extremely flat. We finally ordered dessert, two pizookies. Those took about 30 more minutes to come out and after someone other than our server brought them out our server came and told us she was sorry that the pizookies were also taking longer than normal.

Service: My friend and I got seated pretty quickly on a Friday evening around 5:45pm. However after being seated, our waitress didn't come for about 10 minutes. When she finally did, we ordered our drinks and appetizers all at once. After that, it took her another 10 minutes to bring us water! So much waiting just for water. Our drinks came out quickly after and so did our appetizers. Again, after we finished eating, our waitress basically disappeared because she didn't come to check in on us (I wanted red pepper flakes for my pizza) and she didn't come back until about 15 minutes after we finished eating. I kept seeing her serve the high stool tables, possibly because they were for bigger parties (thus bigger bills and tips, as suggested by other yelpers). She kept refilling drinks and coming back for things they needed, but it took me forever to flag her down to finally get our bill. This is not unusual though--BJ's typically has very poor service because there are always SO many people around and each server has to take care of one too many tables. However, since it was happy hour and Friday evening, I understand why the delays were a little longer.  Drinks: The slow service didn't take away from the amazing drinks and food though! I ordered the Arnold Stronger, which as basically an arnold palmer with simple syrup and Kettle One Vodka. It came out stronger than I expected but after squeezing in some lemon juice, it tasted amazing. Refreshing, flavorful, and something new. My friend ordered the pear cider which he enjoyed as well. It was a half cider half beer type drink so it wasn't too sweet but still tasted much better than plain beer!  Food: We ordered two appetizers: avocado egg rolls and goat cheese flatbread. The avocado egg rolls are a favorite of mine and never disappoint. They are rolls of thin bread fried with avocado, cream cheese, some sort of chipotle sauce, and tomatoes. They come with some sweet sauce, but you really don't need it. The avocado rolls hit the spot everytime and I couldn't resist from eating most of the plate while sipping on my drink. Perfection! The goat cheese flatbread was tasty as well. It was a thin bread with goat cheese, zucchinis, mushrooms, tomatoes, and light pesto. The slices were light and flavorful. Only thing i didn't enjoy was how much goat cheese was on some of the slices, but if you like goat cheese, you would love this flat bread! The pesto was also a good consistency because it wasn't runny and oily on the flatbread either.  Verdict: Despite service issues, I always love coming to BJ's because their drinks and appetizers never disappoint me! I want to come back for the stuffed mushrooms...already dreaming of them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=980

It's always crowded, the service is really slow, and there's usually a long wait for a table just because the food options as far as real restaurants go is fairly limited here. I do like the food.  The spinach and artichoke dip is sinfully creamy and delicious, it's my favorite.  I usually go for a personal deep dish pizza or the open faced chili cheese burger with shoestring fries, yum. I love their pizzookies!!!!  A freshly baked cookie still piping hot topped with ice cream.  One time the server mentioned you can split the cookie if you want, which blew my mindddd.  I will never have to debate over a chocolate chip one or an oatmeal one ever again....

Yah, I know it's a chain restaurant, etc., but I've enjoyed most of my dining experiences mainly because of the food (minestrone soup, caesar salad, sliders, spinach artichoke dip, and pizookie dessert).  I was surprised to hear there was a 30-40 minute wait on a Monday eve. What the hell!?! We took a chance and found a table at the bar (woo woo!) There were seasonal beers, and stoked that they had a pumpkin ale. Yummy! The pumpkin flavor wasn't overpowering and just perfect. They had several new items on the menu, and was happy to see they have a tomato bisque soup (a fav of mine), and of course, ordered the soup and salad combo. The soup was steamy hot and could see all the herby tomatoey goodness, and was not disappointed. 'Twas good to the last spoonful. Of course, you can't come to BJs and not order a pizookie!!! Ohhh, I love the warm choco chip cookie gooeyness and two heaping scoops of vanilla ice cream. So sinful, but who cares!  Service was superb, and was pleasantly surprised. Our server cleared the table and gave us menus within minutes of sitting down. Food arrived after a short wait (and trust me, I've waited for over 20-30 minutes for food, which at times was the wrong order). When our server went on his break, he stopped by to announce it and introduce his replacement, who was equally attentive to us. However, my friend and I were there long enough for our original server to return back.  I was happy to end my long day catching up with a dear ole' friend (my childhood BFF), and enjoying a quite pleasant dinner at BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=980

Worst service and food. We sat down and I ordered the classic burger cooked med and my wife ordered the unlimited soup and salad. After a few mins my burger came out, waitress drops it on the table and left. No can I get you mustard or ketchup. anything?  Just walked away. Let us sitting there for another 20mins waiting for my wife's soup and salad. No other wait staff would stop for us when we tried to flag the employees down for help Finaly was able flag down the hostess and ask for her order. She said she would ask the manager. ( just want the food) finally after another 10mins out comes my wife's food. The different girl drops it on the table and asked if she wants anything else and stats to walk off as I ask for ketchup. It didn't end there. But now to the food, soup was cold, salad was warm, burger was well done ( order was for med) and bun was stale and hard. we didn't complain we just ate. Waitress never came back to ask for anything else, wife had to flag down another waitress to get a refill for her soup ( menu said unlimited!?!?) got attitude for that as well.  Waitress wouldn't get more salad for her , and we had to wait another 15 mins to get the bill. After we go it we waited 10 mins before we decided to just pay cash , since nobody would come and get out credit card.  Worst food and waste of time ever.

What came out was not what I ordered. For one, the crust was soggy. Two, pizza was cold. And lastly, THERE WAS NO MEAT ON MY PIZZA. I was too engrossed with conversation with my friends to realize this so I had about 3/4 of it before I realized it had no meat. I told the server about this and he said ge probably mixed up the pizza and offered to bring me another one but since I had already eaten most of it, I felt that there was no point in getting a second one. I was already completely full. Now, I'm really not one to complain about a whole lot, but I felt that there could have been something else done to fix the situation.

We only saw one couple ready to leave as they were finishing up their pizookie, so we stood close by and patiently waited.  While we did, I got us some beers (I ordered the Hefe and she had a Raspberry Belgium beer) and she found a high top table in the bar.   After looking over the appetizer menu, we were contemplating on getting the wings which i always get yet she never had OR to go with something lighter and that neither of us had.  We agreed on the NEW Ahi Poke which was new to the both of us.  Seemed kinda weird for me to order that at an American chain restaurant...just saying.  For Dinner, she ordered the Sliders with the wedge cut fries and i settled for a small Cheeseburger pizza. Ahi Poke: WOW! What a suprise, this was definetely on point!  I can compare this Ahi Poke with a lot of asian restaurants and this can run with a lot of them.  You get that nice chunk diced cut of fresh tuna, the saltiness from the soy sauce and that refreshing taste from the sesame oil.  The ""lettuce"" slaw was a nice addition to it and had a nice little peppery taste to it.  The fried won-tons complimented the Ahi Poke extremely well.  Kinda felt like I was eating Ahi Poke Nachos (minus the cheese)...hmmmm Sliders: This is what she ordered.  She only ate one of the four sliders that were on her plate as she quickly became full.  Maybe the dranks killed her appetite? LOL  I picked off her plate and took a small wedge fry.  It was nice, crisy outside and tender on the inside, seasoned very well.  Cheeseburger pizza: Never a disappointment!  She seemed to be amazed by it as well as she was eating a slice of pizza that I put on her plate. Kindly took the diced pickles off her slice as she's not a fan of them.  mmmm thank God I ordered a small, HI-5 for leftover pizza!   Service: 5 stars.  Our server Mike was very kind and attentive to us. Was on point with his waiter attributes and always asked if everything looked and tasted good.  This had to be the first time a waiter/watiress asked if the food LOOKED good.  Interesting saying...

So we get there around 7pm and was told that there would be a 25 min wait, which was great since it wasn't an hour. So our buzzer finally rings and we get seated. Service was a little slow from the get go but it's okay since we weren't starving or anything. We start off with a pepsi and a jerryburst (1/2 jeremiah red and 1/2 berry burst cider which i had to explain to the server) then we order a calamari and a large pizza to share (half great white and half buffalo chicken. Asked the server to not put any mushrooms on the pizza and to add garlic. Got the calamari and it was cold and spongy not like it should be which is light and crispy ate it anyways. The Pizza finally arrives 40 mins later and guess what .. my side was covered in mushrooms. Flagged down the server and told her i asked for no mushrooms and she said yup i told them no mushrooms and i told her well why is it covered in mushrooms then.. she said she apologizes and that it was the kitchens fault and not hers so she takes the pizza back. She comes back with the same pizza and tells us that go ahead and keep this pizza and she asked the kitchen to make a personal pizza with no mushrooms of the great white. That's fine and all but as soon as the bf started to eat the pizza i noticed it was doughy so i asked him if it was cooked through, he told me to try it and i did and it wasn't cooked all the way. The pizza was hard to rip and the bottom was doughy and undercooked not crunchy at all, so we had to send it back. Management comes by and apologizes and tells us that he has a new one in the oven, i told him to cancel it and that i would just like the bill for the calamari and 2 drinks but management was nice and told us to not to worry about it and told us that when we were finished we could leave at anytime and to visit them again in the future.

We came here for lunch and pizza and beer which sounded pretty good to my stomach. It was around 2pm we came here and it was low key and not so busy seeing that it was a brewery and kinda like a pub. We sat at the bar in front of the 4 screens of soccer, ESPN, more soccer, and skateboarding. We ordered the Southwestern which was a new item on the pizza menu and beer. The bartender had to talk to his manager because my ID was outta state (OR). It was  inconvenient but it's protocol for them. Whatever.  The pizza was alright.. i think that's cuz i forgot to ask for tobasco sauce. haha whoops. But it was tasty and satisfied my palate. I was a little disappointed with the taste since my friend told me it was the best, minus a star. The amber helped me fill my tummy and get a little rosy in the face. I do like the fact that you can walk around in the mall after filling up the stomach. :D Minus a star since I don't come here enough so I gave it an Okay rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1020
Olivia V.,"San Francisco, CA",293,118,811,4.0,7/5/2009,"I love BJ's...it beats the Elephant Bar at Serramonte hands down. But it's a bit of a drive from the city so I don't always find myself here. Boo. Yeah, it does get crowded and you are likely to have to wait for a table, but if you come around 5ish and avoid the dinner rush, the wait is nonexistent. They do handle large groups well though, and it's a nice place to have a party of 10+ people. They'll accommodate. I like their sliders, and they'll cook it to your specifications topped off with a side of yummy wedge-cut fries! They're fried to a crispy golden brown, yay. You wouldn't think that a place like BJ's makes hella good pizza, but they do. My ex boyfriend is a huge fan of the cheeseburger pizza, and it tasted like a cheeseburger...in pizza form. Um, what else? Awesome bartenders. They never get my ""Shirley Temple with a splash of pineapple juice"" wrong, and it's always consistent.  The food is typical for this type of restaurant: pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, salads/soups, pizza. But the servers are always efficient and on top of things by asking if you want refills and if everything is going well. There are flat screens all around the restaurant and huge ones above the bar, making it an ideal place to watch the NBA finals! There's an outside patio that I've been wanting to sit at for a while now...I'll just wait for the perfect summer evening.

So, maybe things have changed?  I decided to try the online pickup order. Pickup time...11:30am. Okay, so I call in at 11:00am to confirm my order's pickup time. Confirmed. Head over there. Arrive for pickup at around 11:35am. At 11:45am the guy working the pickup line is still on the first two customers he was helping when I walked through the door. The guy is obviously super flustered and cannot handle more than one thing at a time. I was there for 20 minutes, without ever being acknowledged! By 11:55am, I have sought out help from three other employees (host, waitstaff, etc.), because if my food is ready...then it's getting f*ckin' cold! Finally, at around noon, they gather my three item order. Yes, a mere three simple meals. Yet, they completely forget the soup on one order. I didn't even bother to call after I noticed it missing, because I could not deal with any more frustration for the day. One of three items was a pizza, which was super wet and soggy at the bottom! Totally gross! What'd they do? Mop the floor with it? I spent over 30-minutes waiting for an 11:30am pickup order. If I had this much time to kill, I would have eaten at the restaurant!!! I nearly missed a meeting, waiting on this stupid order! I love BJ's, but I totally hate this location. The management and staff are completely unorganized and the staff do not know how to work under pressure. Yes, the kid working the pickup/express line was totally green, but if he sucked, it was obvious that he had no training and they do not have a system in place to organize their food orders. The kid working the express line needs training. He also needs backup! There were three hosts just standing around doing nothing, while this kid was freaking out running back and forth from the front to the back, and frazzled trying to take phone orders (difficulty multi-tasking). The hosts were just standing around with their thumbs in their ass. Two hosts are more than enough--there were 3 or 4!!! Put someone else at the busy pickup/express station! The cooks/chefs aren't getting orders out on time! Who the hell is making sure that food is being expedited out of the kitchen? The manager(s) were probably shopping at the mall, because no ONE was managing SH*T! People need training and the higher up(s) should get fired or go back to waiting tables, because things here are run chaotically and unprofessionally!!!

The table we were seated at had food and what appeared to be love stains all over the seats. I had to ask for cloth napkins to lay down because it was slightly terrifying. Our waitress was completely absent. Not once, but TWICE we placed drink orders from the General Manager (who was great, actually) because she was no where to be found.

First, we sat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Several minutes pass, and the bartender didn't even say hi once. And no, he was not busy. In fact he was so not busy that he managed to make the people's next to us drinks and chat with his coworker (probably comparing goatees). So, we moved to the dining area. Big mistake, we should have just left.  NO ONE greeted us for 10 minutes, Not even a ""hi."" Luckily, Carlos, someone that we've met before was working and took our order even though he was supposed to be off. If it were not Carlos, we probably would have just walked out. I ordered fish and chips and my boyfriend ordered pork chops with extra mashed potatoes and clam chowder. We also had cheese sticks to start off. The clam chowder came out barely warm. Whatever, mood is sour, but I'm ok. Entrees came out and his mashed potatoes were COLD. Like just came out of the fridge cold. I've had enough after that. I told a manager and he was nice and comped our entrees. I NEVER complain about anything when eating out. This place is just awful.

The server never once came back to ask for refills and only refilled after we asked for it. Then when we ordered our dessert but then realized we wanted to change it she told us she had already put the order in and couldn't change. She then comes back another 10 minutes later asking what we wanted instead because she canceled the order. I don't understand why she didn't do that in the first place when we asked her in the first place 10 minutes ago instead of waiting so long to cancel it.

Why am I still giving three stars? Well, it is open late, in an area where a lot of spots close early. Particularly good that it is open late on Sundays -- yes, world, there are people who need food and a shot even on Sunday nights. Particularly so close to the airport, where Sunday is usually one of the busiest, most stressful days.

Two people do NOT need twenty minutes to decide what we want to eat. Oh by the way, I WAS STARVING. Thanks, jackass. There were two women at sitting behind us who had just arrived and he was treating them so much better than us. He finally came to take our orders and I asked for water. Did I get my water before all the food? NOPE. So he walks by, and I ask again. He apologizes and goes to the table behind us. He seriously gave them an entire tutorial on how to make their iPhones run faster because the new update made them slow. That took about 10 minutes. I wanted to get up and punch him in the face because NOBODY wanted to hear that. The women didn't even seem interested. They just wanted their food, not your damn advice.

I translated the WHOLE menu to them, both regular and the kiddie menu and they ordered a good amount of food. (Dessert too!) Not that I expected any sort of complimentary food or discount for my assistance, but the fact that they didnt even offer was sort of reflective of how lacking they were in customer service. C'mon now, its just business ettiquette if someone goes out of their way for ya!  Getting back to my friends, they had messed up our orders (which is something I have almost no patience for). We had ordered a Cajun pasta with angel hair (that we specifically requested), but they brought us fettucini instead. My order was the Thai Salmon dish, but there was nothing Thai about it...and the Salmon, like the Ahi, was questionable.

I know BJ's is a chain place but it does have its good points. The one I appreciate most is the late night happy hours: half price on some decent appetizers and personal pizzas as well as a dollar off their tasty brew.

Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,1.0,1/27/2009,"How do I rate thee? Let me count the ways... 1. Came into the restaurant around 9:30 p.m. on a Saturday with no front desk staff to greet us. Rather there were two girls in black shirts talking and giggling and pretty much carrying on until one finally nudged the other and motioned for her to do her job. 2. Sat down in the main dining room right next to a server station. No big problem there but you'd think if you're right next to the computer terminals and condiment station, someone would notice you after 15 MINUTES???? I watched an entire 4th quarter without someone stopping by. We even put the menus to the side of the table. NOTHING. 3. A female server comes by finally: ""Are you guys ready to order?"" ""I'll have an iced tea."" ""I'll also have an iced tea."" Tick tock tick tock...8 minutes go by. ""Here's your water and here's your iced tea."" (I should have known where this meal was going by then.) Not only did this chick not get the drink order right but where's the damn sugar?? We had a California Chicken sandwich and their Cajun Pasta. Now a few words about sandwiches: It should have lettuce on it. Some sort of vegetable-something with color, nutrients-SOMETHING! All I could see and taste on it was massive loads of butter, cheese, bread. That's it. Where's the lettuce, tomato, pickles-anything?? The only thing saving that sandwich was the fries which WERE hot. Cajun pasta had a horrible sauce that reminded me of Chef Boyardee. Now you all know Chef Boyardee from when you were a kid right? I'm not paying $16 for something that's coming from a can. I send the pasta back and you know what? She didn't look surprised the food was coming back. What's worse? The manager walks by, points to our table, look at our server then nods and walks away. Wow...not even worth his time for a quick visit huh? I'm not coming back ever then.

Some servers though have been OK, but as far as service goes, in letter grade, I'd give it a C+, and I'm a nice person, so that's giving them the benefit of the doubt that they just don't know how to multi-task or have poor situational awareness or need to be re-trained. I've ordered take out from here, I'd actually suggest that at this BJs. Super quick, never messed up my order, and no wait!

Eugenia X.,"San Francisco, CA",47,7,8,3.0,8/9/2012,"Came here because of the pizookies and the lunch deals they have from 11-3pm  Got here a little too late for that but definitely will come back next to try it.  We got seated right away, our waiter came right after I think his name was David. We order fried calamari, stuff mushrooms, mini great white deep dish pizza, the thai mango salad, and one of the mocktails i think it was a peachberry.  The food came kind of slow.. our appetizer (fried calamari) didn't come out first, came after everything was served. The mocktail was decorated with a salted rim like how a cocktail would. When I looked at it 3/4 of the glass was filled with ice, tasted watered down. I asked for another one with light ice, and more tea. He came back right away with a new one and it was much better. Fried calamari was a big hit for my boyfriend he loves that stuff, we're always looking for some good calamari. It comes with a ranch dipping sauce and a a lemon aolli. The deep dish pizza was pretty good, it had a lot of toppings on it they weren't being cheap! Thai salad didn't seem really authentic to me. Maybe it's because I know usually it's made with green papays, fish sauce, and soft shell crabs. Instead this was replaced witchili powdeh lettuce, some shredded mangoes, some bell peppers, some chili powder, some avacado, and deep fried wonton stripes. The stuffed mushrooms were my favorite. Small bites with bursts of flavors. After all of that we ordered the mini trio pizookie. White chocolate macadamia, red velvet, and oreo. When they came Ohmygod my boyfriend just grabbed the white chocolate one and NOMED IT ALL.. He was so amazed. They come with big scoops of vanilla ice cream. It works really well because the cookie is baked in a little deep dish, the pan is still hot and the ice cream just melts on the pizookie. It's heaven.. The food is pretty good, I love the bar. They have so much choices. They also have happy hour only at the bar area.  Our waiter was kind of mia and took some time to notice us. We caught him watching tv lol. Other than that I'm looking forward to visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1080

Took long time to get those.  What? You want us to eat like we're in the Stone Age?  With our hands? 4.)  Ordered Spaghetti with meatballs. No meatballs.  When brought to server's attention, was told they don't really have meatballs but only meat is in the sauce. But told him it says in the menu:            ""Spaghetti with meat sauce......$11.00                    with meatballs....................13.00"" Got the meatballs, ga-zillion minutes later.

You are stupid for trying to wiggle your way out of this one with the stupid, lame excuse for getting the order wrong.  Next time, just own up to it and fix it right away. 5.)  Dirty glass used for soda.  At first it was not noticeable because glass was full.  But  as I drink I noticed spots and solid, dried up stuff on the glass.  An unwashed, dirty glass.   These are not just honest mistakes. These were due to laziness, inattentiveness, irresponsibleness.  Clearly reflects on the character of this server.   And Miguel, you're lucky to get $3.00 for a tip.

Alessa S.,"Daly City, CA",29,5,,1.0,5/2/2012,"DISCLAIMER: This review is in regards to large events/parties at this location.  1) LIMITED RESERVATIONS FOR FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS: You have to work with the time they have available for large parties. Because of the busyness at night, they generally only do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays during the lunch/late afternoon schedule, which is really difficult on a Friday considering a majority of people in our party are working, and don't get off until 6:00PM. As result, I had to schedule the dinner for a Thursday night.  2) UNPLEASANT STAFF: In arriving at the restaurant, the manager approached a waiter to let him know he would be handling our party. Since finding out, the waiter (I wish I could recall his name and will update once I find it) along with another employee obviously did not want to serve our party. This was apparent in the fact that I heard them talking amongst one another about the burden of serving our large party and the constant disgruntled stares I received which made me feel VERY unwelcomed and uncomfortable.  3) RUDE SERVER: The 1 star review is mainly in part to the HORRIBLE service we received. I understand that our server was unhappy with serving our party, but he didn't need to make it so apparent. After the dinner, many people in our party expressed how un-attentive and just plain RUDE our server was. He had an attitude with every one of our guests, which was unnecessary. (Again, once I get his name, I will update)  4) NO BIRTHDAY PIZOOKIE: One of the perks of having a birthday at BJ's is you receive a birthday pizookie. Towards the middle-end of dinner I asked our server to please bring out the pizookie with the candle. 30+ minutes pass, it never comes. As he's walking by me handing out to-go boxes, I tell him that they never brought it out. He tells me, ""Oh yes, let me go check on it."" Another 30 minutes pass, he comes back with the bill, NO pizookie. I give him my card to pay, and tell him a THIRD time to bring out the pizookie. He takes the bill with my card and says, ""Let me go get it..."" I must have missed him, because when I come back to our table the copy of our check is there and our server LEFT FOR THE NIGHT. NO thank you, NO bye, and NO birthday pizookie for my boyfriend after asking THREE times for it. I then tell another server who walks by that our original waiter never brought it out, and still it never comes.  To add insult to injury, upon gathering our things and walking out, another server approaches us at the exit with a to-go tin and says, ""Here's your pizookie... TO-GO."" No ice cream, no candle, and cold in a box. What really upset me is the fact that they were never planning on bringing it out while we were there and had it waiting in a to-go box. *The only PRO is the food and alcohol selection they offer at the restaurant. Horrible service and was constantly ignored by the servers! I definitely do not plan on having a large group/party at this location again. For the amount of money and business we gave them, NOT WORTH IT.*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1080

Foods awesome never had a complaint... sometimes its crazy packed but what bjs isnt? And prices are reasonable.  I Loooove their pizookies and the stuffed mushrooms. My usual is the grilled chicken pasta or the turkey club. If I am feeling like a fatty I will order the rack of pork ribs. Any way cool place to be with your best friends or fam.

Jeremy C.,"South San Francisco, CA",60,26,,3.0,2/5/2012,"Do you like waiting an hour and a half for a table?  Well if you do, then you have found the perfect spot for dinner!  Don't worry, if they tell you that you're table will be ready in 30 minutes, you'll get to wait 90 instead.  Gives you plenty of time to go to the Asian store a few stores down and rub some Buddha belly. As for the actual restaurant, we got put in the back on a Friday night.  The waitress was very busy and before getting our drinks or taking our orders, she kept reminding us that she was very busy and would take longer to do her job. I ordered a pizza and a cream soda.  The cream soda is BJ's own concoction which costs $2.99.  The trick is, drink as much as possible.  The idiots that I ate with also ordered drinks but only got maybe 1 refill.  I got 3 refills so my cost per glass turned out to be only 75 cents.  It's like printing cash. The pizza was ok.  I shared a large with a friend and there were a few slices left over.  On that topic, when someone says a couple, what number does that represent?  I always thought a couple meant 2, but having that discussion, other people said that they think a couple stands for 3.  I think they are morons.  End of story.

Marycathry V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",128,83,25,1.0,10/7/2011,"The customer service here is terrible. I placed a large order for pick-up for myself and all my co-workers and had specifically told the girl over the phone that we only had a photocopy of our boss's credit card and if that would be okay. She put me on a brief hold, then said that it would be fine. I got there about 45 minutes later and waited in the line at the take-out counter. No one acknowleged me, and I even went to the host stand to ask if there was anyone who could help me with my order for pick-up. She just directed me right back to the line I was already in. So I waited another 5 or so minutes until finally someone came back and helped the frustrated customer in front of me. When it was finally my turn, all the bags were set and ready to go, so I handed the girl the photocopy of the credit card. All she says is, ""Ohhh...THAT'S what she meant."" So I said, ""Is there a problem?"" And she says, ""Well, the way she explained it to me made it sound like you had a photocopy of his ID, not his credit card..let me go ask my manager.""  Two minutes later, the manager comes up and says, ""Hi, unfortunately it's our policy that we have to have the credit card present because there's no way of us knowing that that person authorized you to use their card."" Naturally I began to say, ""Okay, well what if I call my boss to have him authorize the transaction.."" But he didn't even let me finish my sentence and cut me off saying, ""Yeahhh...we can't do that either."" I explained to him that I had specifically asked the girl about this over the phone before even placing the order and all he could do was shake his head and mumble, ""Yeah..sorry."" I have worked in Customer Service for over 7 years and even though I understand their policy forbids them from typing in a credit card number without the physical card present, I know that he, as a manager, could have made a judgment call on that one.

I would write off this poor experience to a particularly busy (maybe short staffed?) night, however the last time I visited with just my boyfriend the service was also very poor.  We returned tonight to give this particular location a second chance, but the next time I will definitely endure the 15 minute drive to the BJ's restaurant in San Mateo.

Considering they made is late to pick up someone from the airport because it took 20 more minutes to cook a new pizza the RIGHT way.  Needless to say....

The top was cooked okay, but the bottom was soggy. The pizza was placed on a large place which may have been the reason, but the pizza was lukewarm and the bottom was soggy. It was pretty gross.

It's such a simple dessert concoction that one can easily make at home, but for some reason even knowing that I can simply save money and make my own, never stops me from getting one at BJ's. I think the reason why is because whenever I get one, I get one for free. The technique to doing so is to simply tell your server that it's your best friend's birthday while she's stepped out to the bathroom and VOILA you've got yourself a free divine dessert with no extra charge! Trust, it never fails... until one day BJ's management reads my Yelp entry and decides to enforce a ""check your ID to clarify your birthday"" policy. Great... Anyway, I stressed earlier that I come to BJ's for their food and not their service because I've had a handful of loony servers for the last times I've been here. Personally I think there's a difference between being friendly and being overly crackheaded happily friendly. The last two times I went here I had one of those servers which left me feeling reluctant to ask for another glass of water so I wouldn't have to hear how my server loved the new Lady Gaga album and how she's a ""free bitch"" and have to hear her sing broken lyrics to such a fine song. Geez lady, please let me enjoy my meal in sweet solitude with the occasional drink refills and ""how's your meal"" next time. Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1140

Melissa G.,"Chicago, IL",27,23,,1.0,4/19/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night, place was pretty busy but didn't seem too chaotic. We asked how long the wait was and the host told us about 15-20 minutes, she gave us a pager and told us we could walk around the mall but not too far. After 45 minutes we asked the host what was up and how much longer she thought it might be. She seemed a little flustered and said soon. I noticed some people just walking in and sitting at tables near the bar so I asked if we could sit up there and she said yeah all that is open seating, would have been great to know that to begin with but accidents happen and she probably just forgot to remind us or maybe thought we had been there before. The food was okay but some of it was definitely frozen and not fresh or made in house.  They have a ton of beers on tap which were all pretty good.  Service was okay, server didn't really check back on us, which kind of ruined it for me because I ordered fettuccini alfredo and it had been sitting in the window for a while because the plate was super hot when it was delivered and the all the sauce had dried up and the pasta was stuck together. We were almost done and the server came to ask if we wanted any desserts but I asked if he could bring me a side of alfredo so I could finish my dinner. He did and apologized for the way it came out but we never saw a manager nor did one come to our table.

Came here for a last minute b-day dinner because no one in SF would accommodate 20 last minute guest  =P Ordered the Jambalaya and a Pilsner to combat the spicy kick from the Jambalaya.  BJ's version is dry and heavily spiced.  I wish they offered Étouffée but then again it probably wouldn't taste so great since its a chain restaurant. Some people ordered the deep dish pizza and it looked pathetic.  More bread and crust instead of generous toppings.  There were appetizers but nothing memorable.  I probably wouldnt come back.  In all honesty I only went because my friend ex-boyfriend was there and she needed a skilled c*ck blocker.  Its the least I can do because she's my wing girl. =D  Otherwise I would've stuck to the original plan which was dinner in SF with a smaller group and everyone would meet at Roe.   Ps: Roe sucks. avoid but if you must then bring good people with you and drink heavily because you'll want to forget the idiots you encountered earlier in the evening.  IE: when you were sober. =P,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1140

Our food was under-cooked, and sent back! Im assuming they were short staffed, which is common, but you should NOT seat people in areas where there is NO help. We would of been content on just waiting or going to another nearby restaurant...at this point, a Big Mac would of been better than the mess we were served! Although our food was under-cooked and cold, we still paid our bill and tipped John more than 18%...it wasn't his fault. He tried to do damage control but it was too late.

Once you get past the frustration of getting a table things are pretty smooth sailing. The food is what you'd expect, and the staff is ok...

Once we are seated, our waiter seems to be within the last hour of her shift by never smiling & bringing our WATERS to us 20 minutes later. The food was pretty good, but not worth no hour of wait.

Lady needed to get a clue, since she asked ""What I needed?"" mmm anyways. We were seated and given our menus. We ordered: Potato Skins, Calamari and the Mediterranean Pizza.  I'd pass on the calamari unless you enjoy LOTS and LOTS of PEPPER. Potato Skins were alright and the Pizza was tasty.  Service pretty much sucked. We had to ask for small plates a couple times. Our drinks were alright as well. The strawberry mojito tasted the best, I would get that again.

I tried their deep dish pizza and I was not impressed. Theres too much dough and seemed to lack enough sauce as it seemed dry. I didnt try anything else but my friends got the 1/2 lb burger and the Jambalaya which looked decent but not worth the price.

We used to be regulars until we went there a few months back and had a horrible experience. Since we come quite often I know what their food should taste like. Our pizza was somewhat burned and after feeding the kids a slice each, I realized it was off. I lifted the toppings and sure enough the top of the pizza dough was slightly burned. No big deal, asked our waitress for another and she was totally cool with it. She went and told her manager and that's when the horrible experience started. I believe his name was Tracy, middle aged guy seemed like he was tweaked out on something. He came over very aggressively and said ""so what's the problem with your pizza"". I said it was slightly burned and that we wanted another one that wasn't. He walked away almost like he was pissed off at us. My husband sensed it right away but I told him no way, that's probably his personality--he is a manager after all so there was no way he would treat a customer rudely. After maybe 15 mins our new pizza came out and was much better. Tracey came back and asked how our pizza was (and for that split second I thought, ok cool we were just trippin about his rudeness) and when we said much better he proceeded to say ""ok, it looks the same to me. Let me know if you need anything else"". Are you serious?! Why would I make  my starving kids wait for a whole new pizza when there was nothing wrong with it? I was NOT asking for a free one, I just wanted a non-burnt one that I was paying full price for. Total jerk, def on something.

It's a shame that Tanforan doesn't have more exciting mall type shops that make waiting forever worth it. Cheap, super trendy shops just don't have anything to offer me and sitting in Barnes & Noble browsing books for extended periods of time is fairly dangerous.  On our last visit, we noticed that they added another aisle to the dining floor and as a result have probably 16 more booths for parties of 2. Sadly, this didn't have an affect on the wait.

Sandy L.,"Oakland, CA",6,56,,3.0,7/12/2011,"Dinner with BF and two of his BFFs. We had a hard time choosing from the menu because everything looked and sounded delicious, but we didn't want to be disappointed.  We ordered the Best Beginnings and Ahi Poke and devoured everything. The only disappointment with the Best Beginnings were the mozzarella sticks; I think they were underdone. I loved the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Eggrolls. Yummy! The boys each ordered a giant baked potato and an entree. BJs was not lying about the potatoes - those things were gigantic. I didn't get to sample because I was working on my own entree - Shrimp Scampi. I think they gave me three servings on one plate. Nonetheless, it was delicious (even moreso with Tabasco) and I think the breadcrumbs with the pasta made it a winner. I was disappointed with my Strawberry Mojito. It was gross. The Blonde beer was not bad - I'd drink it again. I took away two stars for the mozzarella sticks + drinks and my super sticky chair. When I left, I noticed my pants and my bag became all sticky - what was up with that?! Ugh.

Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,1.0,6/30/2010,"We came here once before and had to wait terribly long for both our food and the bill, so we didn't have very high expectations when coming here again. However, BJ's surprised us once again and this time we had even worse service. (If you're wondering why we even bothered to come back, we came here per the request of a coworker who was celebrating her last day -- and the reason why she chose this place was likely b/c she had a gift card to BJ's) After setting us up with waters, our waiter took our appetizer order and then told us to hold off on ordering our entrees so that he could put in the appetizer order. A good 10 minutes later, he came back to take our entree order. A coworker and I chose a salad to share (when he ordered for us, he pointed to the large size and even emphasized that we were sharing). About another 10 minutes later, our appetizers came and then about 15 minutes after that, our entrees arrived, all served at once by a few assisting waiters. When our salad came, it was the tiny lunch portion! We sent it back since it obviously wouldn't be enough for both of us, and emphasized that we ordered the full-sized portion. After waiting another 10 minutes while everyone consumed their food, we asked the waiter what happened to our salad. Apparently there was no communication and he didn't even know we sent our salad back to get a full-sized order! So he had to go and put in another order. Abut 10 minutes later, when our coworkers were done with their food, we asked again about our salad. He said it would be ready in 5 minutes, so we asked that it just be packed up to-go. However, when another 10 minutes passed and everyone was ready for the bill, we were so fed up that we decided to cancel our order. Finally 5 minutes later, our waiter came to us with the bill and our salad packed to-go. He said we had a choice to make: we could take the salad or not take the salad and he would deduct it from our bill. Even after such poor service, he wasn't going to offer the salad for free or at a discount! We were so over the thought of eating an over-priced salad that we declined and opted to just grab food from our much cheaper on-site cafeteria at Genentech. This is definitely the last time I'll ever go to this BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1100

Vibe is excellent..and the drinks are decent. Not fond of the ""measure and pour"" tactics of the bartenders, but they do have rules to abide by. If one is looking to get drunk...either go to real bar or sneak your own bottle in. Just sayin.  Oh..and let me just say, if you haven't tried a Pizookie...well..try it dammit!

Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,983,177,1.0,9/12/2010,"I've finally figured it out. I've analyzed my relationship with BJs because I've been coming here steadily (well, steadily across CA and AZ) over the past 8 years. I've always loved their salads. Always. I've sung their praises. I've written haikus over their pizookies. It was that good for me. Five years ago we moved out of the country for a year and then landed back in the US, this time in AZ. Low and behold...near our sketchy apartment was a BJs! YAY! ( ) Salads made me happy. Pizookie made me happy. Beer for hubby? Not so much. We moved in AZ, buying a home. In that area, just up the 202 towards Chandler, we found another BJs that was located in a mall. Hubby, being the beer man he is, was excited because this is the BJs where they brewed their beer and distributed to the other BJs across the state (or so he read in his research). Plus, the brew master worked there 5 days a week. I think he was having visions of beer discussions. Anyway, here is the review I wrote for that BJs -    Their service and salads sucked in the times we went. We stopped going there. Cupertino BJs, here's your review I wrote -   - despite the fact I've been here at least 10 times. I finally remembered to write a review thanks to the handy check in thing for Yelp on my iPhone. And this place, the San Bruno location, is the BJs that put the nail in the BJs coffin for us...We will not come to a BJs ever again. It's being removed off of our chain food list. How did BJs screw it up so feckin badly for us? A) The Beer. Over the years we've had consistently shitty tasting beer, but when BJs get their beer right we immediately overlooked 4 years worth of bad beer. But do we really want to wait every 4 years to have one good beer make up for the others? No. Like I said, we've finally figured it out. Just a note: if you're going to say you're a brew house/brew pub, your beer had better be fucking stellar. Fat Tire is not the be all end all. Fat Tire is one step above MIller High Life for n00b beer drinkers (that stunning analogy came courtesy of beer lover and consumer Matt) who think they know their brew. They don't. They really don't. On a final note, we don't know what the hell all the BJs do, but somehow, their beer consistently tastes old and stale. Like it sat out in the sun before going into refrigeration. How can all the BJs manage to screw it up? Maybe it's the distributor they use, but when you somehow manage to screw up a Guinness on tap, you're in big trouble. B) The Food. Over the years the food has gotten saltier. While I still enjoy their salads, I can't really deviate from anything else because the salt content is so high it adversely affects me - my fingers swell, I drink a gallon of water and then spend the rest of the day (or night) on the toilet. Sorry if it's TMI. C) The Service. I know that my husband can be fussy about his beer. He's not shy about sending it back. I'm not shy about sending my food back, either. We're not rude any time we've had to do it. But for some reason, the moment we do it, our table becomes a ghost town - completely devoid of service. On several occasions we've almost walked out because we were kept waiting for 20 minutes before our server would come back. This not only happened at this BJs, but the Cupertino and Chandler, AZ, one as well. Anyway, long story short...stick a fork in BJs for us. It's done. We won't be coming back. After 8 years, I'm finally kicking your restaurant to the curb. No more making excuses.  I will no longer be a victim to your bad food, bad beer and bad service any more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1100

Great beers and beverages.  I love their clam chowder and salad for lunch.  The Thai chicken lettuce wraps and their Pulled pork sliders are also delish.  Oh, and if you're feeling indulgent, their spinach artichoke dip is great too.   This is a popular place, so get used to stalking tables at the bar or be prepared for a 30 minute wait.  The staff has always been friendly and will occasionally come around with appetizers while you're waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1100

I never do Yelp reviews, but this was enough to make me write one. At around 9:15pm, my boyfriend and I walked into BJ's, hoping to get a simple takeout of appetizers. I should've spotted a red flag when the total for 3 appetizers came up to $40. We waited about 20 mins for our food, and as we check the food before we leave - we realize we got the Sriracha bacon mac n cheese, when we specifically told the guy we wanted the appetizer one. My boyfriend hates Sriracha (I know, right?). Guess the guy couldn't figure out where the option for mac n cheese was on the register, so he just took the closest one. They also never informed us that the appetizer gourmet mac n cheese was removed from the menu. We return the mac n cheese, only to see there was nothing on our sliders except the beef + the bun. No tomato. No onion. Nothing. All the while, employees are on their phones, gossiping. I've worked in retail/customer service, and no supervisor of mine would tolerate having a phone out during shift or not keeping busy in some way. When the sliders came back, there was cheese, but nothing else on them - that alone took 15 minutes. The employee then told us, ""The chefs do what the chefs do.""

So we were okay with that since we were waiting for some friends, but then our friends showed up about 30 mins later. This was fine, but then as 1 hour approached, suddenly our time was pushed another 30-45mins. Needless to say, we were not all thinking happy thoughts. After a while, we began taking over seating as they became free within the bar area. It did get to the point where we were all pretty much seated and ordering.  Here's the sad part, we ended up getting seated at a table for 12 (which we needed), but 2 of our guests had already left because it was too late. And as we walked to our tables, we noticed a slew of empty tables next to the table we were going to be seated at.  Anyway, we decided we'd waited this long and we went ahead an ordered.

All in all, it's an okay time but I think the company you are with makes up for it.   Also, ask to be served by KIM, she's the best and made all the other times that we went worth it.  How often do we have personality with our waiters and waitresses?  She'll sit with you and joke around with ya.  She was so good, we tipped her 30%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1220

Karim R.,"San Francisco, CA",74,215,1,4.0,5/18/2009,I came to BJ's for my pre race meal with GG Saturday night .  It was a great  vibe in the spot and our bartender was GREAT! Shout out to Ruben who makes a mean Long Beach!  Ruben took really good care of me and GG drinks appetizers he handle the meal and still made drinks for others on the side.  We had the chicken wings and the spinach dip for appetitizers and they were so good.  I love crispy and spicy chicken wings and the dipping sauce yum!  The Spinach Artichoke dip was good too but I think I like the colorful chip better!  Me and GG ordered two sandwiches she had the turkey burger that looked very good with potatoe wedges and I had the grilled california chicken sandwich. This is a good sandwich but you need the avacado to make it complete! I know because I took off the avacado on one half of the sandwich.

I was actually very pleased during my visit :) Since it as beautiful outside we decided to sit outside and eat.  Our service was excellent as sometimes I fear when you eat outside they forget about you.  They didn't :) I ordered 2 small mini meals that was new.  The hawaiian shrimp skewers and the Mozzerella and Tomato salad.  It was excellent!!

My name is ______ and I'm here to service you."" Yeah, I have immature friends. Men: can't live with 'em, can't send them off on a rocket to Mars. Moving on... What can I say about BJ's that hasn't already already been stated? The food is decent for mall fare. There's nothing outstanding on their menu but it gets the job done if you're hungry and you don't feel like getting something from the food court. It's good for groups if you want to sit for a while and catch up over food.The wait is always super long on Fridays and weekends so you might want to make a reservation if you know you want to eat here with a big group. I've been here many times and nothing has ever stood out enough to me for me to order it again on future visits. I will say that their salads are disappointing though. Stay away from them. The desserts are pretty good but it all sits on the cusp of overly sweet considering how their menu caters to the average American, so too much sugar is pretty much a given. The same applies for most of their food: too much fat, too much grease, too much salt, etc. When you come here, come for convenience and the social aspect. If you're here for the food, just expect average American fare along the lines of Elephant Bar and Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1220

Elsa C.,"San Francisco, CA",20,24,11,1.0,7/24/2012,"Probably the WORST customer service I had experienced ever...I had waited a while to write this review so it would give me time to cool off and put things in perspective.  My friends and I came in to watch the last game of the NBA finals because I remembered while eating here how many big screens they had everywhere, and the boys needed to watch their basketball. So, I arrive and the place is already packed but with less than 10 ppl in the waiting area. I walk over to the hostess podium and wait patiently for the golden haired hostess who is finishing up something on the computer to ask to put my name down. I wait, and wait...and she doesn't acknowledge me so I think I better get her attention by saying ""excuse me?"" and she kind of holds her finger up at me and gives me a fake smile and says that she will be with me in a minute with a slight edge in her voice. That's fine, you're busy, I work at a restaurant...I get it. BUT then on the other side of the large podium a line starts forming and another hostess appears, and proceeds to take care of that line. She takes the name of one party, and then another, and the golden haired waitress pays no mind to anything that's going on. Seeing that two parties already had cut me in the line to put my name down, I ask the first hostess - ""umm, should I be asking HER to put my name down since you're busy?"" And..the golden haired hostess totally ignores me! I'm pretty annoyed at this point, but I walk over to the other hostess, a dark haired girl, and I tell her I tried to out my name down with golden hair earlier but she blew me off. The dark haired hostess apologizes and gives me a pager, and takes my party of 7 down and tells me it's going to be about half an hour.  I wait patiently again for my pager to go off. 45 minutes later, I go back up to the podium and ask what the deal is, and a third, african american hostess takes my pager and goes ""hmmm...i don't seem to have your reservation in our system."" REALLY? After all that you lose my freaking name? How else did I get a pager if you didn't take my name down? Not her fault, i know, but I glare back at the first two hostesses I encountered. The third hostess apologizes and tells me she will see what she can do. She is probably the only capable hostess out of the whole lot since the others were either rude or incompetent to not even take my name down when I already stated how bad I was treated. I arrived at 5:45 to put my name down. When we got seated...guess what time it was? 8 freaking thirty...almost 3 hours because those hostesses were so incapable of doing their jobs. It was just plain ridiculous. I would have left if the guys weren't so adamant about not missing the game.  I am writing this to management of this establishment because I want them to know how poorly I was treated and how incompetent their hostess staff were. I never even got an apology from the first two, it was only the third hostess that looked really sorry and tried to help.  Also, when we finally sat down my friend sat down to a plate with leftover food on it. When he asked for another, the waitress gave him a replacement with an equal amount of leftover food, not once, but twice! Gross.  I will never EVER be coming back to this BJ's location again. Such a shame because I love their pizza and pizookies. I hope management cracks down and makes sure nothing like this happens to anyone ever again because I will say it again HANDS DOWN WORST HOSTESSES and CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1220

We asked our waiter where our appetizers were, and he said another waiter took our appetizers to the wrong table so then he canceled our order. And you tell us this NOW?! Then our waiter said he can make another order for appetizers, but we told him it was fine and that we could just eat our dinner instead. So the waiter gave us our dinner, but my friends got a mini pizza instead of a medium pizza like they ordered. Our waiter then said that he heard mini instead of medium, and that he was sorry so he gave us the mini pizza on the house. That was a kind gesture, but that was two mess ups already. I got the BJ's favorite pizza, and it wasn't that bad. I DID want to try the Avocado Egg Rolls, but the silly waiter had to bring it to another table... Ergh.

First, it took about 10 minutes for our waiter to introduce us, and by that time we were already ready to order out entree. In addition, we ordered two appetizers and he promised they would come out before our entree, but isn't that normally how it works? We waited another 15-20 minutes and for some odd reason our entrees came out before our appetizer. Our waiter also didn't notify us that he was going on break, so I informed his replacement about our appetizers. He made sure to double check on our order but it never came. We asked to cancel one but to bring out the chips and salsa since its easier to make and it would've taken another 20 minutes to make the mushroom spinach appetizer. I finished my entree before the appetizer even came out, so that frustrated me. The waiter told us it was coming and by that time I just wanted my check. I asked for the manager but he never came out. Was he that ashamed of his employees to not speak to a customer about their poor customer service? I don't know but I know he wasn't busy and was dodging my table. All I wanted to tell him was how disappointed I was with my dinner and that I've never had a bad experience prior.

We were served in the bar (the greeter said there were no tables for three but we could see them empty) . Our waiter  seemed to be the only one there and was running ragged. It also seemed to be end of shift . The manager should know better than to run a place like that. We ordered simple food. Chili for my wife and pizza for me. How could it be easier. Just get chili from a pot. I got my pizza after a while and luckily shared with my wife. Three quarters of an hour and several ""I am sorry"" stories from William M, we cancelled the pizza. No explanation. No nothing. Drinks were late too. I am not sure what was going on but do not go there execpt if you want to drink. And sit at the bar where you can grab the bartender. Food service was impossible. They need waiters and cooks--this is a big place. And then there were the bathrooms. They needed to issue wading boots to get to the urinals. The dirty paper towels were piled about a three feet high near the sink. And my wife said the womens was a mess too. So I do not know what happened to my old standby for quick food.

The traffic was terrible and raining, but we were seated within 10mins as BJ's was as normal packed to the gills. We were seated in the ""lounge"", an area we haven't seen yet but from afar, way in the back and flat-screen television monitors all over the upper walls at every angle. I ordered a plate of fried squid which was very good, I was amazed. Our friend ordered a clam chowder but wanted the bread bowl to be served separately; they instead served it inside, so she sent it back. It was returned and seeing the inside of the bread bowl still wet, determined all they did was pour the chowder out and scrape the wet bread out. What kitchen knuckle-heads. Sis ordered a baked potato w/cheese and bacon bits, and a bowl of chili soup. The soup had to be requested again, and the potato had the cheese but no bacon. I have to hand it to our East Coast waiter because he was fabulous though the kitchen help was ""lost in space"" and hadn't found their way back to the kitchen....  or elsewhere!

She snippily replied ""running time right now is 47 minutes"". I asked her how long take out would be and she said 15 minutes.  My son was in his stroller crying while we looked at the take out menu, and while the two hostess talked crap about us right in front of us about how we changed our mind.  This pissed me off because I could hear them and the other hostess looked at my son rolling her eyes.  She came by with some crayons and paper and gave it to him and said ""your welcome"" what a rude girl!   My husband grabbed the crayons and put them on the table because of her rudeness.  While we waited for our take out, they persisted with giving me bad looks and starring at my son.  We walked and waited outside because of how uncomfortable they made us feel and my husband walked passed the door and heard the hosting bragging to the cashier at the take out corner how she rudely gave the crayons to us to shut my son up.  My husband never complains.  At this point he walked in and she turned and said ""is there anything I can help you with?"" sweetly.   He told her ""no I didn't ask you to give us crayons and I didn't appreciate that.  And I don't appreciate you chit chatting to your friend about us either."" Just as he said that, the manager walked into the conversation.  We walked outside and the manager apologized.  He was nice but didn't offer any type of compensation for their rude behavior and our incredibly long wait.   It really isn't even about the long wait.  It's really about how these girls continued to talk crap about us while we were there.  Yeah it's loud in there, but I could clearly hear them.  It really ruined my night.   It was pretty over priced.  I payed 42 bucks for a large bj favorite deep dish pizza and sliders.   Then the icing on the cake!  My son and I were the only one who ate the sliders...and we got very sick!  Like sick to where my two year old was doing projectile vomiting and diarrhea.  I was doing the same for 2 days.  We were flying out to Hawaii 2 days later and it was the most miserable experience to watch your two year old in pain and you yourself is puking.  My husband can only help so much due to his condition.  Maybe they did something to my food because I was really pissed?  No idea, better to be safe than sorry.  NEVER EVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1240

Braden K.,"Honolulu, HI",516,390,3,3.0,7/14/2011,"in my dirty opinion, the only BJ's that get 5/5 stars are 1. my favorite adult actress in my favorite adult film. and 2. my ex-girlfriend during that threesome on the beach with our friend jack daniels. just keeeding! on a more serious and appropriate note, I've heard nothing but hype hype hype about these famous BJ's spots.. I finally came through with some co-workers after handling some business and we all ordered different dishes. SERVICE: it was great up until about mid-meal when our waiter courteously handed off to another waitress who was friendly and perky though slow like yurtle the turtle.. ATMOSPHERE: sports bar theme. decent lighting, comfortable seats, several plasma televisions with all different sporting events going on simultaneously. my kind of place! too bad we were on the clock, otherwise i'd have ordered a few rounds! FOOD: I hate to sound like a snob and it really does take a lot for me to complain.. but for $12, I had expected a rather filling portion. the roast dip sandwich was tiny. a $5-footlong is twice as filling and tastes a lot fresher. the horseradish was the imitated substitute, diluted and not spicy at all. the worst part was the fries. they were soggy, thin like mosquito legs, not filling, soaked in grease, and obviously microwaved. the jambalaya was much tastier. spicy and tangy in flavor, each bite included pieces of sausage, shrimp, and vegetables. it resembled the way I like my women, generously coated in thick, cajun seasoning! just kidding, i'm done. my other co-workers ordered soup, salad, and sandwich combos and fish tacos. speaking of which, I never really understood the 'wedge salad' ordeal? whatever, I wasn't eating it haha   i'll keep it short and end on a good note. the PIZOOKIE saved BJ's life. this little baked cookie with two heaping piles of ice cream on top tasted like it was made from the breast milk of an angel. the combination of a freshly baked, half oreo, half chocolate-chip cookie base with two large lumps of french vanilla ice cream sitting on top was the crème de la crème! i don't even eat sweets. no candy, no soda, no cookies, brownies, etc. but that dessert was the BEES KNEES.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1240

The food is mediocre at best, but there's plenty of room for large groups and the menu is diverse enough so that even the most finiky eater will find something worth eating. The quality of the food, however, leaves much to be desired. The ingredients aren't fresh at all and I have a lingering feeling most of the meals are prepared ahead of time and just need to be warmed or heated through.  Despite the generally low quality of the food there is a bright crayon among the box of dull colors. An absolute MUST at this restaurant is the pazooki.

Albert B.,"Hercules, CA",0,37,,3.0,6/22/2010,"First, I would like to say that BJs is a chain of restaurants throughout the country. I don't normally yelp on chain restaurants, but this is worth reviewing even though there are 500 plus reviews.  My wife and I came here with the family last night and it was unusually busy for a Monday night around 10pm. Our host was friendly and greeted us immediately upon entering the restaurant. He informed us that the wait time would be approximately 15 minutes. We actually waited for almost 25 minutes.  The waitress that served our table was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and the Mediterranean deep dish. The mozzarella sticks are good, but nothing special. I ordered the Nit Wit beer and it was okay. My sister ordered a glass of Pepsi and she stated that it was flat. My wife took a sip and she agreed. However, we were all surprised with the Mediterranean deep dish. Pesto, grilled chicken, fresh tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese, greek olives and jalapenos on the side. Pesto was so good with tons of fresh tomatoes and the right amount of cheese, this deep dish was so delicious. I really enjoyed the deep dish. It was filling and full of flavor. Pesto and deep dish. I never thought of it. A deep dish I highly recommend.  I haven't tried any of their other signature pizzas, because Zachary's in Berkley in my opinion is still the one to beat.  This is a place that is worth coming back when in the area. I'll definitely order the Mediterranean again.  A shout out to Lindsey who served us last night. You displayed a great level of customer service on a busy night. Thank you, Lindsey!  Here's a tip: while waiting to be seated, request a menu from the host so you and your party can decide what to order the moment you get your table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1280

BBQ chicken salad, and I must say the salad was really good and the scampi I would definitely pass on that.. Strawberry lemonade that my gf ordered was a bit too sweet so I wouldn't recommend ordering it.

We weren't really hungry...so that was good enough to munch on before we had our pizookie.  My problem tonight was that the service was a bit sketchy. We got a table in the ""open-bar"" area...so you don't have to wait. That's better than waiting 30 minutes for a regular table. But, I felt a bit neglected here. We ordered a half and half oatmeal raisin/chocolate chip pizookie at the beginning so that it would come out right after we finished our pizza...but I think she forgot to put in the order for it.

Once inside, you're greeted by the best staff ever! My waiter's name was Will that night, a handsome young gentlemen with blonde hair who thankfully assisted me in choosing my meal. It was his favorite, the Chardonnay shrimp pasta, I put all my faith into him and trust me I was not disappointed. Light, creamy and savory, the pasta was like heaven in my mouth. I also had the egg roll appetizer, which my best friend had picked and that was just wonderful! I was not dismayed by any wait time as it was speedy in my eyes and also I was occupied by the games on the various flat screens around the room. Then to top off the night, when I was already a plump marshmallow, dare I say it I had the pizookie. Half chocolate chip and half cookies nd cream(or Oreo I'm not sure what the difference in those terms are). It was the most amazing thing you could ever have in your mouth!

Didn't need to wait too long for a table and the servers were very friendly and accommodating.  When I came here a few days ago... Not only was it unsatisfactory for me, but my friend was also irritated at how badly we were treated. The hostess said we'd wait around 25-30 minutes for a table. Okay, that was fine since it was around the dinner rush. We were given a pager and walked around in the mall for twenty minutes. We come back. Ask the hostess to see if they've called us, just to be sure. They haven't yet. We sit down on the booths provided for us, to wait. 45 minutes pass. Nothing. An hour pass. Something's wrong. Both me and my friend approach the hostess. APPARENTLY, they HAD called us. Uhm, no. The pager didn't vibrate or light up. She asks to check it and what do you know.. THE PAGER WORKS. Alright, strike one. You lied. We were seated quickly. Good. I ordered the creole tilapia with an iced tea and my friend got the flatbread pesto pizza with strawberry lemonade.

The food tasted amazing, which is why I'm not gonna give this place less than 3 stars. It's everything else that prevents me from giving a better star rating.

It is hard to put the mediocrity of this place into words; in a genre of restaurant defined by the relentless pursuit of the lowest common denominator, BJs is the Platonic Archetype...the sort of place where you can hear 3 consecutive Smash Mouth songs...really. I happened to be at Tanforan and wanted a salad and my friend convinced me they were the only viable option, so in I go and am confronted by a menu that I can only assume was constructed by the culinary equivalent of madlibs , where ingredients are randomly juxtaposed (can you even taste aioli under bleu cheese?) (side note: Feta is apparently the new ""it-cheese"" of corporate executive chefs everywhere it was on at least one-third of the menu items, so some industrious sourcer must have hit the motherlode).   I choose the Garden Salad (w/o Feta) and for 4 bucks more I have them slap some flame-broiled Salmon on it (gots to get my Omega-3 on)...after what seems like 8 Nickelback songs later, the waiter finally shows up with my order and tells me it's because the salmon takes so long to cook (uh-oh!).  The Salad as it turned out was merely a low-tech delivery system for basalmic vinaigrette (I could have used a straw) and was nearly inedible. The staff was nice and the service was attentive (though no one was wearing enough flair for my money) although there was a weird interlude right before the check when my waiter noticed my fiddling with my iPhone and out of no where goes all Steve Jobs on me, demonstrating all the sweet apps he'd downloaded from the app store. Like I said, a bit unfair to hold a place like this to any sort of elevated standard, but when I get charged 13.50 for vinegar-logged lettuce and particle board salmon, I must raise a voice in objection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1340

I tell her, no, I called in 45 mins ago. she tells me well, you have only been in our system for 20. I pull out my phone, and i show her my timestamp. she says ""oh, well maybe one of our take out people took down your name and gave it to us 20 minutes late. your wait is still another 20-30 minutes.""  1. regardless of the fact that this situation is just plain stupid, the girl had the audacity to say ""you've only been waiting for 20. you still have another 30 ahead""    look, you are wrong. and not only are you wrong, you should have said something along the lines of ""im sorry ma'am, we show here you just checked in 20 minutes ago"" but instead she got super attitudey like i was being an obnoxious guest, pressuring them for a table.  she says theres nothing else she can do, gives me a pager, and tells me i have to wait another 20 minutes. fine. i take the pager, and sit down, very upset that this little biatch is speaking to me very rudely when a. i am the guest and b. i have already been walking around the mall for 45 mins waiting. i return to the host desk 20 minutes later, ive now waited an hour+ a few for a table for 2, when i was quoted 40-45 minutes. the SAME RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE asian girl says to me ""no one has been seated. there are still 12 people ahead of you."" now, I used to work for bjs, for 4 years. i started off as a host. I was a host before they had the computers to do all the math for them, i had to use my brain and estimate wait times myself, and coordinate tables and stagger seating myself. i also was one of the first people to use the new posi system for table management. i also was in take out, i was a server, and i was a trainer for all three departments. I KNOW HER JOB, IVE HAD HER JOB, AND I KNOW YOU DONT TALK TO GUESTS LIKE THAT.  but, far be it from me to say to her ""look bitch, i am the guest. the GUEST, not the customer, the GUEST"" instead i just bitched my husbands ear off and sat in the corner with a very upset look on my face furthermore, i know bjs is the type of corporate restaurant where you talk to a manager for one little thing, BAM free dessert or comped SOMETHING. but no, i didn't take advantage of that, i didnt throw this girl under the bus, i just silently stewed.  i am clearly irate at this point, and the girl is adamant about making me wait an hour and a half on a damn thursday for a table for 2. the very NICE girl behind her (tan, maybe hispanic girl, wearing glasses i think?) said ""we have a table, we can take her"" UH? HELLO? anyway, our server was great, she was like a robot, ""have you made your selections or would you like a few more minutes"" type thing, everything was to bjs fantastic corporate standards. food was bjs, and as usual, i tipped 25%, because, i know a server doesnt live off of compliments or warm fuzzies. heres a tip, hosts, you are the face of the restaurant. you are the first person the guest encounters during their meal. if you fucking piss them off with your snobby ass holier than thou attitude, you're just setting a bad tone for dinner, and a bad tone for your servers' tips. its customer service. expect to be shat on, expect to be treated poorly, by people many levels below your social class. but its your fucking job, do it right, be grateful you have a job in this economy, and try to keep it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1340

The great white is my favorite, it's chicken Alfredo pizza. The only advice I'd give is to avoid the patio. The servers only seem to come around on occasion, and I think it's the ""you're stuck with the patio"" kinda thing, so they're usually not friendly like you get inside.

Judd H.,"South San Francisco, CA",29,38,,3.0,2/5/2009,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewery has become somewhat of a stomping grounds for me and my cronies, but the question is why? BJ's is located on the outside of the futuristic looking Tanforan mall. You will know you have found BJ's when you see what looks like a poor mans spaceship, if you see a legit spaceship you have probably walked to far (New Mexico). Now the service really depends on what time you get there. If you get their at prime times, you'll be seated promptly and taken good care of, and by prime time i'm thinking 7pm to 7:03pm. The service here is pretty poor. I've actually got my meal and desert and check before I even to a glass of water, amazing right? Now the food is pretty good, I mean nothing outstanding just good. However, the prices are quite ridiculous. Pasta is at least 12 dollars (you can get a way better pasta for that price almost anywhere else). Appetizers are at least 10 bucks (other than the wings you are being ripped off), basically you are paying for somewhat high class food but receiving low brow hobo food. Now I posed the question how has this establishment became a common stomping grounds for my cronies and I, well one reason is it opens late, but there is another reason. The same reason why i've given this place 3 stars instead of negative 2. Every weekday night from 10pm to close BJ's has a special, a happy special, where for those 4 hours everyone is happy, and joyful, and and the costumers are happy because of this special, I forget the name, but I think its called ""10pm to Closing costumer joyful hours"". Whatever the name is, it is awesome Mini Pizzas prices are 50 percent off (still amazingly it cost 43 dollars), appetizers are 2 dollars off, and beer is also 1 to 2 dollars off.

All she did was drop off our food and walked away never came back to check on us not once! 15min. went by and still no one came to check if we were ok or if we needed any refills etc. When my father wanted to order another beer and I wanted to ask for a glass of water we waited until one of the servers walked by and actually paid attention to us to actually help us.  20min after we had already finished with dinner  the server came to the table dropped the check didn't say anything and walked off! Didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything just dropped the check off and walked off with a stupid bitter look on her face! At this point I was upset and mind you I am server myself and I understand that when you're busy, you're busy but at least ask one of your coworkers to check on your table if you cant.  I went to talk to the manager and explained to him what had happened and that was a mistake. When I told him that I understood the restaurant was busy his response was ""we're not even busy it's pretty slow"" needless to say I became livid!!! If its not slow then why the f*ck is the service so shitty???? He offered to discount the bill but at this point I just wanted to leave and did not want to wait another 30 minutes for my bill. I just wanted to get the f*ck out of there and go home. He ended up discounting the bill.  The server was lucky I left a damn tip but I wasn't going leave without A.writing on the check how much she f*cking sucked so she can read it and B. telling her to her face that she fucking sucked and that she was lucky i still left her a f*cking tip. 15% grat too!!  Never again will i come back! food was decent service was SHIT!!!! 2stars only because the food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1360
Christina D.,"San Francisco, CA",13,45,,4.0,5/31/2008,"Let's be fair, while you might always have to wait for hours on weekends to get a seat at BJ's (in our case, the server told us THREE hours for a table of 8), which chain restaurant doesn't?  We don't go to chains for top notch service, we go because when you don't feel adventurous to try a new place, you always know what you're getting here.   BJ's is one of my TOP TOP favorite chain restaurants.  Good atmosphere, awesome beer & drinks, and even better food.  I LOVE their deep dish pizza: order the works or BBQ chicken and you won't be sorry.  The crust is so moist and soft, and the stuff on top complements each other perfectly.  I'd take that over many sworn by pizza joints in SF like Amici's anyday.   The best way to enjoy this place is to go with a group of 4-5, find a seat at the bar area so you can avoid the hour long wait of the restaurant, and share a pizza with several appetizers follow by the famous pazookie.  The appetizer that I absolutely love is the chicken wings, comes with 8-10 wings drizzled in ranch and hot sauce; crispy hot and juicy, yum!.  The pazookie never intrigued me as much, but you should give it a try.  C'mon, we can all ovenbake a cookie and top it with some ice cream, doesn't take a genius to make.   Lastly, they have a great happy hour from 3-7p M-Thur.  1/2 off on mini pizzas, and some discounts on appetizers and beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1360

The other time was because they accidentally gave our pizza to another table so when we told the waiter, he told us what happened and got to work making another one, again the manager didn't charge us. How lovely! For beginnings, I don't think you can go wrong with the spinach and artichoke dip. Just think about it. Colorful tortilla chips dipped in a warm cheesy dip. Oh man. It even smells good, too! Lol. Or you can order the Best Beginnings sampler platter that has a little of about 4 different dishes.  Their strawberry lemonade isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Sometimes it's not sweet enough and other times it's a little too sour. :[ For a meal, I usually order the grilled chicken pasta. It's good! BUT again, sometimes there's too much sauce and other times there's not enough sauce. I guess it depends on the chef's mood? If he wants to be generous or not..

We're an understanding bunch and we know that it was probably an overwhelming day for all the servers, but would it hurt to not look like you just want to get the hell out of there? Anyway, we ordered some fries, honey chicken salad, a pizookie and consulted him about one of the dishes on the menu because my friend, who has zero tolerance for anything spicy, asks him about a dish and how spicy it is. He says that it's not spicy at all and of course, we trusted the guy. The time comes for our dishes which were to say the least alright. I'll admit, I had high expectations for a place this popular but I would compare my chicken salad to something I would get at Applebee's. Not that great. My friend gets her appetizer that is supposedly not spicy. She tried it and her face dropped. The appetizer wasn't as mild as we were told. I tried it as well and I love spicy food, so when I tasted it I knew my friend couldn't handle it at all. Strike two against the server. I think the only redeeming quality of our meal was the pizookie which you can't really mess up. After we were done with our meal, it took forever for our server to come back to us with the check. We paid and I thought that the first time shouldn't make me hate the place. But the second time I came back to this establishment, they did not redeem themselves. The second time I went here was for my roommate's birthday. We were a huge party of 14 and they had reservations for us. It took awhile for us to get seated. Understandable. Until we realized the place was slightly more empty than expected and there were a couple tables available. Then we were finally seated and lo and behold, the same server from the first time I came to BJ's is serving us. He took our orders, which most of us had the same choice (Chicken parmesan) and my friend and I had the chicken fried steak. After some waiting, all of us got our orders at the same time. All of us except me. I thought, oh okay, it's a steak, maybe it's taking a little longer than usual. Then I notice oe of the food servers was looking over our table and noticed my ""WTF where the f*** is my order?"" look. Our main server comes over and asks what I ordered. ""Chicken fried steak."" ""Oh, okay. *has an OH SHIT look on his face*"". So it turns out that he didn't write down my order. Okay, so you wrote down 1 chicken fried steak even though we specifically ordered 2? Wow. Awesome. He asks if I would like a soup or salad while I'm waiting. And pay for an additional order while I should be enjoying my main dish? Thanks, but I'll pass. So my order comes in, fresh off the grill and I can tell it was made in panic. At that point I was pissed off and didn't really enjoy my meal. I ate most of it because I was hungry and saved my appetite for that night. We got our checks and he had this idea to split the checks into 2 separate tables in order for it to be easier for us to pay. Also, that DOUBLED the gratuity for himself. Smooth move. I was just glad to get out of there and go home after that. Needless to say, that was the second and definitely the LAST time I'll ever go to that BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1380

Cindy G.,"South San Francisco, CA",9,27,4,3.0,7/27/2009,"This place is always packed. When I don't feel like dealing with the parking and traffic woes of SF, BJs is a good alternative for some food and drinks at the bar, especially during happy hour when you get more bang for your buck. They also have a heated outdoor patio with a fire pit for those sunnier days, which don't come often enough in San Bruno.  I usually order a bunch of items from their appetizer menu to have with a Nutty Brunette (she's my beer of choice there). Their chicken wings are the best. The sliders are good too, even better with cheese and bacon. I also like their chicken wrap, but be careful with the horseradish sauce. It looked like some kind of mustard sauce so I poured a generous amount onto my wrap, which gave it so much kick that it brought tears to my eyes. If you have a bigger appetite, you can't go wrong with their pizzas. SO good. I just wish their entrees were better. Oh, if you do get dessert, try the pizzookie. It's a giant chocolate chip cookie in a pan straight out the oven.

I ordered a ahi tuna salad and a drink and my brother ordered a crusted chicken dish with soda,  he tried offering us appetizers but i didn't want any. We waited for about 15 minute for our food to come, while i waited i see the manager chatting it up with the waiters and waitresses near the computer where they input orders. I was disappointed i paid 15 bucks for a plate of crap..i literally got a plate of salad with maybe 2-3 piece of ahi tuna which was covered in tons of wasabi and the size of a quarter, it literally looked like i got scraps of whats left over, the whole plate was loaded with fried oily crisp, and throughout the whole time we still had no waiter.

Lileth M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,59,,2.0,3/18/2010,"I have been to BJs numerous times especially when we want something fast, good for large number of people, celebrating a low key family gathering - mind you my family is not small - immediate family is 18 ppl from parents to grandkids - let's not forget our extended family! Whew - tired already! Anyway, I stopped going to this location just because the management service I received on Father's Day in 2009 is lowsy. Yes, it's been a long time and I am finally writing about it.  The reason I called is because of the Mother's Day experience we had. We waited over an hour for a large group. While seated, one of the server told us that they were taking reservations - we were not aware that there was a policy in place. So I decided to call ahead of time and spoke to one of manager named Peter, and asked him whether we have to make a reservation ahead of time. The manager is not aware of the policy so he put me on hold, waited for 5 minutes and he came back on the phone and told me ""NO."" I reiterated 3x that I want to make sure that we are not going to have any problems come Father's day and said we should not. So on the day of, I came in really early and the hostess told me that we have to wait over two hours and we have to talk to a manager. I spoke to Mario one of the MOD and he told me that they have been taking reservation for over a week now. Mind you, there was lady standing next to me hearing the same thing. By this time - I was livid! I walked outside to talk to my sister about the reservation, and while talking to my sister, I saw him seat the lady who was standing next to me - the party of 13. While having the conversation with Mario, I explained to Mario that I work in a fine dining restaurant here in the city and we don't have this type of problem - not communicating nor getting a memo about taking reservations on large parties especially when it's Mother's Day, Father's Day or any holiday. Every restaurant especially a chain have a policy in place and to make excuses for a manager who's been for three years is not a good excuse. P.s. Mario quoted me a two hour wait. We called the other BJs located in San Mateo and quoted us a 15-30 minute wait. We made our reservation, drove to San Mateo and texted my family about the change.  I would give the BJs in San Mateo a 4 star, partly because of food but how they handled our situation! This place rocked! Better service and we were seated right away, the MOD/Proprietor was fantastic! The only reason we had to wait is because they want all of us to be there - I did not mind at all - we were all there within 10 minutes - traffic coming from San Bruno to San Mateo.  P.s., I emailed and complained about the service and yes, I received an email from the District Manager and said that he's going to talk to his manager. Whether it changed or not - I still do not know.  Living here in the Bay Area gives us a lot of opportunities to go and eat in a lot of fantastic places from taco trucks, whole in the wall places to fine dining - from $ - $$$$ - I've experienced it.

It was yummy; cripsy but not dry at all. It was the only chicken wings I would crave. However, there was one time that the wings came out horrible.  I guess a change of chef or just a bad day.  It tasted like frozen wings that you over microwaved (and trust me! I know how that taste).  But other times, it's became good again(although not as yummy as my first time luck of the draw). I like their pizzas (1/2 off the minis during happy hours) and can't go wrong with the spinach and artichoke dip! It's a good place to go have your beer and good pub food to hold it down.  Their happy hour specials are pretty descent; I can't complain. Don't have much to yelp about their beer selection.  They do have their house brews with cute names, but a beer is a beer anywhere :) BJs statisfy my craving for beer and chicken wings.  I'm happy (and so is my tummy).  Writing this review is making me a little thirsty ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1480

I started out with the Brewhouse Blonde, and I found it a bit on the lighter side.  It was good though.  My friend orders the minestrone for starters and a meat lasagna.  I order the house salad with honey mustard and a pot roast entree.  The food arrived fairly quickly, and I must add that the two people who worked our table were superb.  I had a spoonful of soup.  It was good.  The vegetables on the salad were cold and crisp, but something about the taste of the croutons was very annoying.  My beer is gone by then, and I order a hefeweizen.  I enjoyed the flavor of this beer much more than the first.  The serving of lasagna was a bit small and smothered in way too much meat sauce.  The two slices of garlic toast that came with the entree almost equaled its size.  The pot roast was tender and flavorful and I liked the white cheddar mashed potatoes, but the whole plate was drowned in a salty brown gravy.  The steamed veggies served on the side were good.  Anyway I got a chance to view the conclusion of the snowboarding so I was happy. I'd give this place 3 and a half stars if I could.  Considering how many people were dining at the time, the service was excellent and the beer is very good.  Our food could have been much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1480

They had just opened.  You would think service and food will come out pretty quickly. Think again.  Server Alex took our order 5 minutes later. I ordered unlimited soup and salad, and my son ordered kids meal (ribs). Our food came out 25 minutes later.  My soup was warm but I didn't complain. Half way thru my soup, server Alex asked how everything was. I said good, but can I have another bowl of soup (knowing it would probably take a long time to get another one). Soup came out 15 mins later (really ?). There was a couple sitting near us who had complained about there wings not having enough sauce.  Alex took it back and it came back with more sauce in less than 2 minutes. Why did they get better service, maybe because their bill would probably be more, meaning more tip for him ???  I have done this job before and yes, unfortunately it does happen like that.  The bigger the bill the better your tip will be. Someone else brought the soup. I made the comment  about how long it took then asked her if I can have my soup to go. She said yes I can get that for you, but never came back.  I sat there for another 5 minutes waiting for Alex to come to my table. He never came back. So I finally waved down a manager, William, I told him all that had happened. He apologized and said he will minus my meal for the inconvenience. I did also tell him that Alex never came back to face me to apologize for anything. That is so freaking frustrating to be ignored when its their job to give you good customer service no matter what you order.  This BJ's Restaurant in San Bruno has gone down in service. They have hired people who do not care so why should the paying customers care to come back ???? I even gave him a tip !!! Why did I do that ??? I guess because my son did enjoy his meal.

Unfortunately, I had hoped for too much.  The pizza, which is served in a heavy metal pan, looked doomed from the start.  First off, the sausage I got on top was little balls of sausage like you see on a Domino's pizza, not the thick hunks that grace a true deep dish pie.  Second, I could see the cheese.  This sounds trivial, but the cheese (a tangy mixture of cheeses, not the bland stuff on this pie here) should be buried underneath a thick coating of chunky tomato sauce.  Instead, there were a small smattering of tomato chunks.  Finally, the crust was all wrong, wrong, wrong.  Rather than being the buttery goodness, raised at the edges to hold in the overflowing goodness of the thing, it was thick and doughy like an overgrown thin crust. When I finished the pizza, I felt like I had a brick in my belly.  I still do.

Lillian L.,"Oakland, CA",80,134,27,3.0,7/6/2008,"Coworkers and I frequent this place because it's reasonably close to work and has good happy hour specials. They like the expansive variety of beers on tap (popular among them are the Nutty Brunette, Jeremiah Red, and PM Porter), and I like that you can get 5 oz. samplers of the beers because I'm a lightweight. What I love most is that you can get Lindemans Framboise here. It's the first beer I've ever enjoyed (introduced to me by the lovely Mr. H), as I don't much like the taste of beer. It's a raspberry-flavored, fizzy drink that barely tasted alcoholic but definitely felt it when I gulped down half the sampler in a minute. I had to quickly rectify the situation by ordering an appetizer.... which brings me to the cons of the place. Firstly, the food is not great. As in... worse than at a baseball stadium. Everything tastes old and microwaved, except for the pizookie (a big warm cookie with ice cream on top), which is quite divine. Secondly, the service is sub par, particularly during happy hour. They're slow to serve and hard to hail down when you need anything. Perhaps these things are to be expected at a place like BJ's, and clearly we don't mind the shortcomings too much because you'll see us here on Fridays... and sometimes Thursdays... and maybe Mondays....

I've been waiting for a while."" Vlattamier replied saying ""Either you wait to be seated or wait for your server, that's how it works here. He will come around, just wait!"" I was so upset!

Mike A.,"San Francisco, CA",3,83,,5.0,8/17/2010,"Ok first of all the host told me the table for our party wouldn't be available for another 20-30 minutes so I walked back to my family waiting outside and discussed it with them and they said just tell them we're in a rush; let's just go to Chili's. As soon as I go back to tell them to just cancel our party the host tells me a table has suddenly become available. That is very good customer service if you ask me and an awesome way to keep guests from leaving.  Second of all we're Thai and there was nothing Thai about the ""Thai style shrimp lettuce wrap"", appetizer we ordered, plus it only came with 4 wraps...our party had 5 people including me. On the contrary the other appetizer we ordered which were the buffalo wings had a nice crisp and I found it hard to keep myself from pigging out on them so I could save room for my entree.. good sized juicy pieces too if I might add, not small and shriveled.  Third of all the entree I ordered gave me the choice of either salad or soup, I opted for the salad...nothing special but the portion was ridiculously huge (ok overexagerating but it wasn't small), definately not your appetizer sized salad here. Now onto the steak (my entree)...omfg it was so good, dry aged (supposedly) and cooked perfectly medium rare just how I like it. You'd be suprised how many places that get this packed end up messing up how well you want your steak. Better than Outback's if you ask me which is funny considering Outback is supposed to be a ""steakhouse"". And like the salad, the size of the baked potato it came with was f*ckin ridiculous, I've never eaten anywhere ever that gives you a baked potato that big...it was bigger than the size of my fist! (that's what she said). Last but not least....my family are probably one of the most irritating people to deal with but the server was incredibly patient with us. 2 thumbs up to her and the host for the good customer service.

Then when my sourdough bacon cheeseburger came out, it was missing the bacon and cheese.  When we alerted them, we were told it would be a moment and they would fix it.  About 15 minutes later, when everyone else I was with had almost finished, it finally came back.  The manager said it would be on the house.  Lo and behold, when the check arrived, we were charged for it. So I'm not a fan of the way they do business here. However, the food is pretty good.  We started with Best Beginnings, the combo appetizer plate of mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, santa fe springrolls and avocado egg rolls.  These are personally the appetizers I would least like to have in a combo platter; I think they should offer some more choice in that regard.  The mozzarella sticks were appropriately gooey and well-seasoned, and the avocado egg rolls were pretty good - and I don't usually like avocado.  Spring rolls were fine, and everyone loved the spinach and artichoke dip, although I found it too creamy and flat in flavor for my taste.  It needed some kick. My burger was also quite good.  A little too big to eat, and the beef could maybe have had more seasoning.  The sauce wasn't exactly well balanced either.  REALLY good french fries, though. Other dishes I'm told are good are the meatloaf sandwich and the Santa Fe salad.  I will have to report back on those, if I ever decide to try this place again.  Iffy given my experience with the service.

My friend who's been to several BJ's says they have the best chicken sandwich in the world so I will try that next time and perhaps that will earn this place an extra star.

He brings my drivers license back to me bent completely in half! I ask him what happened and he said he didn't know the process but, that's how the manager checks the driver's licenses. He bends them in half. I am from out of state in school here. I will not be back home until this semester ends! What if he broke it. It would not be easy to acquire a new one being here in California. This business needs a machine or another way. I got no apology and I was treated as if it was nothing and no thought.

I don't really like that much, but you know, it's okay food and I will keep coming back for more.  on the plus side, the smiley face fries and pazookie are fun to eat. yes but being a beer guy, I come for the beer. their heff is decent, most of the brews are tasty.. it varies with each batch like small brews will. i will let you in on a secret. MIX THEM! not on the menu... but describe it and they will do it. Black and Brown - PM porter and Nutty Brewnette Jeremiah Blonde - Brewhouse Blonde and Jeremiah Red yay! if you don't really like the food, just sit at the bar, eat appetizers and drink up. They have TV's all over so if you like sports thats great. I am not really into watching pompous millionaires play a half-ass game of whatever * ..but to each his own.. most the BJs have DirecTV so they play Fuel, Speed, and the more interesting sports..

Ever eat anything at sports bars?  Yes, the menu has items like onion flowers, avocado rolls, and nachos to start, salads, soups, so-called ""gourmet specialty"" pizzas and other staple basic entrees like pasta and meat loaf.  It's incredibly uninspring and the prices are a little on the pricey side, albeit the fact that the portions are BIG.   The service is fairly good, except that the busy waitress took the wrong order twice in a row and tried to force us to eat whatever she assumed that we ordered.  Yes, I am a stupid customer who doesn't know what I ordered a moment before, duh!

Another time our waitress was more attentive to the table of six behind us. Our last time our waitress was moody and it took her twenty minutes to bring out two waters and a lemonade for my son. Then our food is brought to us by our food runner and we needed a few things. Our waitress was no where to be found. Tried flagging down other waiters and they just quickly walked by our tables as if they didn't notice us. Then a waitress shows up at our table and informs us that she will be taking care of us while our other waitress went on a fifteen.

At this point our friend joins us- now there are 3 of us. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and take his drink order- we also order some appitizers at this point. As soon as they came out, our waitress tells us that her shift is over and asked if we could pay our bill, BUT THAT ANOTHER SERVER WOULD BE BY SOON TO TAKE CARE OF US. So of course we pay and wait for another waiter to come by. Now all 6 of us are here and we have not seen our 2nd server for 45 minutes. YES, 45 minutes. Not one waiter even looks at us. There are 6 of us at a table eying every server that walks passed and no one awknowleged us. We waved down two waiters, both of which did nothing. They gave us blank stares! ""Can we have a waiter?"" *Blank stare."" So we just got fed up and went to the bar tender who is on the other side of the restaurant to order drinks and food. Not being our server, we tipped him before we even received our food. So for the 3 hours we were in the restaurant, we went 2 hours without a server. And dont think for a minute that I'm exagerating this at all. All 6 of us, all waiters, said we would have been FIRED if we treated our costumers like we were treated. Imagine being a waiter and not helping a table for 45 minutes. Not to mention that no one even came by to pre-bus our table.The only reason we did not ask to see a manager is because we're friends with the manager and did not want to bother him. Oh yeah- the restaurant was only about 1/3rd full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1500

Great ambiance, plenty of entertainment and your located in a mall. All I wanted was a cocktail. How busy can a full staff be at 11:30am.

Dave H.,"Minneapolis, MN",38,120,,1.0,1/16/2008,"It's always packed, I think because it's one of the few places in San Bruno that is both clean and unlikely to result in a mugging.  If you work in the office park, there are only so many times that you can eat at the decent Vietnamese place in the shopping center, and as amazing as Don Pico's is, it's too expensive to go there regularly. Location is apparently everything, because there is otherwise absolutely no reason to go here.  The service is abysmal; you'll often see 10 empty tables but have to wait 30 minutes to be seated, and when you get a table, it will take your greenhorn waiter 10 minutes to show his face.  Once you get your food -- it's laughable.  I've had salads with frozen lettuce -- no kidding, practically with ice cubes  -- and others with so much dressing that I couldn't see the ingredients.

kim s.,"San Francisco, CA",33,27,,2.0,7/16/2008,"My daughter wanted to go here for lunch. I was hesitant, but hubby and I acquiesced in the end. WE got o the counter to give our name. The hostess ignored hubby and continues to chat on the phone. I go up next to him and she hangs up, still ignores hubby but talks to me. (Maybe she didn't like what he was wearing that day) I tell her we have two adults and one child. She looks at my daughter who is nine and asks me if she needs a booster seat. My daughter reaches just under my chin, so I'm thinking she doesn't need a booster seat, but ok. My daughter of course looks indignant at the thought of being treated like a baby We are seated about fifteen minutes later. The waitress comes to our table about 10 minutes after we are seated. We have already decided on what we want.  Peanut(my daughter) orders the chicken tenders and a sprite.  I order the turkey cobb on whole grain with a cup of soup. She asks twice if I said club to which I respond ""no, I said cobb."" Hubby orders the patty melt rare, with skinny fries and onions on the side.  Easy right? It was a bit after one o'clock so we didn't order any starters.   Waitress comes back with our drinks pretty quick.  About twenty five minutes later Peanuts food comes along with my cup of food.  Four other tables have been seated around us at this time. We see all of them get served and their orders come before the rest of our meal. It took about thirty minutes from Peanuts meal to arrive to the time my sandwich and hubby's patty melt comes.  I sez to myself they must've messed up the order. Sadly, the order was wrong. My sandwich was fine. But hubby got onions in his burger instead of on the side and he got the big steak fries instead of the skinny fries that he asked for. We didn't send it back because we are now  hungry.  Note, I think it's cool when you can memorize orders and not have to write it on tickets. But if you have suck memory, write it down.

I seriously never heard of this place before, but when we entered in, it reminded me of a high class applebee's... and i'm not complaining. But damn, they had hella plasmas. I didn't count, but sheesh, what happened to saving energy. The wait for our tables wasn't long; it only took about under ten minutes but I've heard it gets pretty crowded near the end of the week. The waitress showed us to our seats and gave us the menus. When I opened my menu, a little stick with a hook and brush one the ends fell out. My friend told me it was a tool to clean ear pieces for for those that can't hear well. I was kind of disgusted.  Our server was really nice to us. He even apologized when he gave us the wrong pizzookie. 0__o My friends also told me he was flirting with me. I should say first that I was fifthwheelin' lol. I thought that was amusing though. haha. What bothered me was how long the wait was to get our food. It took what.... 30 maybe 45 minutes to bring out three entrees. It took super long to me! I was so hungry because I had not eaten the whole day.  I can't lie, the food I ate was delicious. I ordered the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. My friends ordered some spaghetti dish and some small burgers [i don't know what it's called right now] with some crispy fries. Good portions, decent price for it i guess.  For desert we ordered the Oreo pizzookie and the triple chocolate chunk pizookie. Like I said earlier, the server messed up the order and instead of the chocolate chunk pizookie, gave us the original one. It took another 5 some minutes for our dessert, but at least he apologized.

Bringing out our entrees, I apologized for inconveniencing her, but she was totally cool with it.  She helped us move all our stuff over and introduced us to our new server.  He was very attentive, just like the first one and we were able to enjoy an exciting game with no issues whatsoever.  Our server finished his shift and introduced us to our 3rd server.  She was extremely attentive as well.  I have to say, for a sports bar/brewery/restaurant, whatever you wanna call it, the service here (at least tonight) is way above par.  Usually, when you get servers changing shifts, going on breaks...things can get chaotic and you usually get left behind.  But we had a great experience here tonight and we even thought about coming back here the next time we want to watch a game with a big crowd.   Don't expect gourmet food...but what you can expect is decent food for its price, a lively ambiance (during game nights) with great service.  The beer is pretty good too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1500

So far so good. They have a full bar, and 5-6 micro brews (house beers).  Check. We order beers, and get the small novel that  they call a menu.  Typical stuff, upscale for an Applebee's would be my best description.  Burgers, salads, sandwiches.  They also have pizza. We got the beer, it was fine.  Nothing to write home about, but not Bud-Light-Ice-Dry--Ice-with-lime either.   Ordered the bbq chicken pizza.  It was pretty good.  It was very good. The service was decent, but they were definitely busy.  We had to wait a bit for the check.   In short, you could worse for a meal, but better is definitely a possiblity as well.

My girlfriend and I met here as a mid-point between her Marin apartment and my Peninsula apartment. I was a bit late and she spent the time studying the tome of a menu. We both had white wine from the pretty decent wine list. I had the fish tacos. Not great. The ""guacamole"" was this weird creamy bland concoction and the ""salsa"" was watery and boring - a little smoky, but otherwise flavorless. The fish itself was good, but the whole dish lacked spice. Just ridiculous. GF had a good-looking salad with breaded chicken and seasoned wedge fries. The fries may have been the best of everything; they were plentiful and really cheap - $3.95 I think. There were about three people behind the bar. Sometimes. Since I was never offered water, when I tried to order some there was absolutely no one behind the bar. We were asked once ""how is everything"", which is fine, but how often is it that you actually know what you need when they come by to ask? Almost never for me.

Janell Y.,"San Francisco, CA",70,103,,2.0,3/3/2009,"The food here is like your average chain of restaurants like Chili's, Macaroni Grill and so forth so it's a given there will be plenty of good stuff on the menu that's a little over priced. Not to mention, their pizookies are the bomb but of course how can you go wrong with warm cookies & ice cream? Now I have to say most people come for the pizookies, pizza and alcohol because the bar is crackin and it's open late. They also make their own beers which are pretty damn good. By the sound of it, it would seem I'd rate this a 3 star at least but I'd have to say their service is horrible. It's not that their entirely rude or anything but it's just horrible. The hosts/hostesses half the time aren't paying attention and are busy chatting up a storm with each other. I don't really care much for it until it takes forever for them to stop talking so I can tell them I want to sit. When I do finally sit down, my server usually disappears or forgets something like my water. Or my salad. Or my dinner mates soup. Or an entire order while out with a huge group. I know service can't always be perfect but you'd think it would happen at least once, even when it's just me and another person but nope, it hasn't. The service is even worse when it's a huge group, it takes hours to get seated and they don't allow you to reserve. I don't know why they don't because the one in San Jose does and I believe they get a lot more business then here. I understand if it takes a long time to seat a huge party but for the times when it took forever (1-2 hours), the place wasn't busy at all. Eh. I've been here on more than several occasions, usually with a large group and I've been there a few times with just me and another and nothing has ever improved. I don't really know how to explain it. The place is alright but the service sucks and it's not the ""omg I can't believe that just happened"" type of service.

The design and ambiance is interesting and new for our area. The beers taste tested ok. The music type is welcome. I really wanted BJ's to work out - we need another trustable restaurant.  The staff was fine; personable and caring.  However, there are so many different people interacting with the table that you don't see your waitperson that often. ) We requested ketchup with two different people and it never came. Finally, we scrounged a bottle off a neighboring table.)  But these recipes, and the kitchen, just don't cut it. Middle-of-the-road flavors. Nothing striking.  Not one person that went with us in two visits ever said ""wow, that's good.""   So I'll just list the various things that I thought, or others told me. (We did share bites off our orders.)  - No sauce or flavoring on the various dishes were anything more than bland. (Sauces with onion strings are mild and unopinionated. Chili is surprisingly pedestrian. Tartar sauce is almost certainly generic wholesale.)  - Potato wedges that came with a dish were cold - well the ones on the top were. The few on the bottom were lukewarm. But, the food they came with, (battered cod on the fish and chips plate) was hot.  - However, the fish was over-cooked, and, get this, tough and stringy. The batter was chewy, rubbery. Very strange. Not crisp.  - Fish tacos were simply average flavors.  - The Chili Baked Potato was gargantuan. I swear - it's just not a natural size. The chili served over it looked like it had been painted on with a paintbrush - really. Then cheese melted on top of that. The potato didn't ""flake"" when you forked it - it came apart in a kind of pasty chunk. I don't understand how you bake a potato and make it do that. It was cooked and done well enough, but the meat of the potato was like molded paste. I was really confused by that.  - Fiends we saw at a nearby table had a cheese pizza and the chicken baked potato on their table. Said the pizza was ok, liked the crust. The baked potato was being sent back as inedible (didn't like the texture of the potato either.)  There's more, and there were some things I did like (Like the various brews they create.

It was my sister's last night before moving out of state and it was already late so I just really wanted to have dinner (plus she hadn't tried this restaurant yet and I really wanted her to try their pizookies).  Too bad her first experience was like that.  It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  On the plus side (I will give them that much) I wrote a very lengthy and detailed complaint about this location on their web and I got a personal email and handwritten note from their general manager apologizing for the experience including a $25 comp card.  Since this is the closest location to me, I did go back to redeem the comp card---take out of course!

We moved to a booth and things seemed better until I opened the napkin to retrieve my silverware. All the utensils were spotted and my fork had residual red lipstick smeared on it and I opened all six napkins that were on the table.  Then we ordered our dinners. I ordered the baked potato. 45 minutes after taking our order the waiter brings my son and my husband's food and asks me if the manager has spoken with me. No one had. Apparently they ran out of potatoes. I was offered soup or salad after the fact. I declined and still no one came to talk with me. I watched my family eat and our waiter was nowhere to be found. I guess he didn't want to deal with us anymore because of the dinner issue. We had to flag him down to get our check because we wanted to get the heck outta there. Needless to say it was a horrible experience. On my way out I informed the manager of the issues and she told me she would look into it although she didn't ask me for any information so I think it is highly unlikely that she did.

I even had to wait for the opening bar seating here when I went with my BF one night. Other than that, the service is slow. It can vary sometimes and the wait time can be interchanged, removed, added, whatever.

Not a very intelligent choice when you are pressed for time for a quick dinner, but good for catching up with friends. Favs:  -Avocado eggrolls. I hate avocados, but this is good when dipped in the sweet tamarind sauce that comes with it to mask the avocado taste.  -BJ's favorite pizza/BBQ Chicken: Deep dish is my favorite, love the fluffy thick crust. BJ's fav is like a combination pizza with lots of meat and veggies. The BBQ chicken is made with bbq sauce and it tastes a little sweet and tangy.  -Stuffed potatoes: These are ginormous! It's really filling, but I'm not a baked potatoes kind of girl. A spoonful and I will be good without it for the rest of the night.  - Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta: My favorite dish of all time here! Not too rich or creamy. Just the right amount of light sauce, tons of shrimp and tomatoes.

For a place to eat while watching the game intently, go elsewhere. As for the food, it is good. We had the wings for starters and I had the BBQ chicken sandwich while my friends had the ribs and chicken fried steak. FYI, these are big portions. Luckily, I had some good brew to wash it down. Didn't realize it, but they serve pumpkin as their seasonal. I'll have to come back, as the last time I had great pumpkin beer was in Seattle.  Service was a lil slower, but I suspect it was because it was a Saturday nite and there was a huge xmas shopping crowd. Still took over 10 minutes for dessert, which was the brownie by the way. Excellent brownie, but way too much whipped cream. Reminds me of the ice cream sundae Bobby on the Brady Bunch when he was competing in the ice cream eating contest! LOL Overall, probably will come back, as it's better than food court food, but will stay with 21st Amendment or Knuckles to watch the game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1640

What did taste pretty good was the pasta and chicken and hubby liked his grilled chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes (taters were good!) and surprisingly, all 3 chicken dishes we ordered were cooked just right. The chicken was nice and moist.  Our server kept our glasses filled and was perfunctory.  There is an extensive beer and cider list and they make their own brand of ale.  Reservations are for 6 or larger but they'll write your name down and hold it until your name is called and if you don't answer, they'll give your table away.  Still, I wouldn't make a special trip to come here to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1700

My wife and I ask how long the wait is for two people; hostess says it will be around 50 to 55 minutes. I confirm with my wife, and we agree to wait it out - so the hostess takes my name.

Then while we waited we could see empty tables but they told us that they were waiting for one table to leave. it was plain bull.

After two hours we asked and they said that a server had closed the back area so we couldn't sit there. WHAT????  So my manager went to the BJs manager and told him the situation and how we had been waiting for over 2 hours for nothing. His comment was, We quoted you two hours and it's been two hours with hella attitude. My manager got angry and said we were leaving. She was so disappointed because we all wanted to eat there and it was a complete waste of time. It was a going away party for 2 people and it was so embarrassing for her. We had spent so much money buying drinks and a couple of appetizers while we were standing around at the bar and waiting for two hours. What idiots!!! Did they not want our business??? After my manager told us what he said, he came over and said that they didn't have enough servers. We said that they could have at least had us sit down, because we didn't care if we waited.

We sat there and waited for about 15 minutes and noticed a lot of people coming in and being seated. Then we noticed that they all had pagers. One of our party went up and asked the hostess how much longer it would be. Apparently we weren't even on the list because ""we walked away"". We had been sitting there in full view of the hostess the whole time. The bench we were on is no more than five feet away from the desk and there was nobody else sitting there or standing in that area but us.

I usually don't go for deep dish pizza, but if that's your thing I think you would do better with Zachary's in Berkeley, or any Uno's. Not bad, just not that good. Crust was so soft, it was almost the consistency of Wonder Bread. Other than the pizza, the rest of the meal was ""too""...That is, the jambolaya was too salty and too mild, the rice too soft, the strawberry lemonade too sweet. However, the service from everyone was really great. TIP: The signal on the pager they give you while you wait for your table will reach all the way to the Barnes and Noble magazine section, so read on. Overall, there are just too many better choices in SF, or Walnut Creek, or Berkeley for me. If you are stuck in SSF, then I can see the appeal.

I ordered the sliders, they were decent but would have been better if the patty was the actual size of the bun. Yes, the patty to bun ratio was not good. I also asked if the patty could be cooked medium rare. I thought it was a reasonable request. I mean it's a little patty, which doesn't take long to cook anyway and when I asked if it could be cooked medium rare the waiter said the chef usually cooks it well, but he'll write it down that I wanted the patty med. rare. Well, needless to say, the sliders did not come med. rare. My bf ordered the roasted chicken and ribs combo. The chicken was a little dry and the ribs were too.

Alexandra A.,"Daly City, CA",34,44,5,4.0,8/2/2008,"Every time I eat here I am impressed by the food and the service. I guess that will happen when you sit at the bar a lot, even so when I would come here with friends the service was alway great. One thing I have noticed is that if you are seated at one of the table and don't  order a beer the service tends to go downhill a little bit. Maybe it's me but that's just my take. Anyway back to the review. My first time at this place I ordered a fettucini alfredo - regular size. Boy was that filling or what! I came out of there pretty satisfied. Here's a comparison for you when you order the same dish at the Olive Garden it shouldn't be dry and hard but moist and creamy. BJ's version of that dish was just what was expected. And the Olive Garden serves Italian food by default - go figure! It's kind of sad when another restaurant makes something better than you when that's supposed to be what you are good at. Some restaurants have some appetizers that just get you through the time until you get your actual meall. At BJ's just eating an appetizer alone can really fill you up. Now don't get me started on the desserts. They really take care of you here. The BJ's Brownie is really divine. From far away it looks like a small mountain of ice cream, whipped cream, fudge sauce and then the brownie that's slightly warm. Yummy! Thanks BJ's for making a fan out of me.

AWESOME. their salads sound pretty good, although i've never tried it. i'm not really big on getting a salad as a meal, but i would definitely try one of them out someday. the pasta and potatoes aren't too bad. they pass. there's quite a few vegetarian options, so it's good to not have only one thing off the menu to choose from. it's almost always a must to get a pizookie after a big artery-clogging meal. seriously, there's never any room to force a frickin' cookie with ice cream down your throat, but somehow, we manage. it's a big cookie. how can you resist? so all in all, typical restaurant with typical food. nothing super spectacular. every time i've been here, the people working have been super nice and friendly. maybe i'm lucky, i don't know. one annoyance about this place, though, is the noise level. i can never hear what the person sitting next to me is saying. and even then, we have to scream to each other. and then it results to eating silently as though we were mad at each other or like we haven't eaten for days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1740

My mom tells one of the waiters again and they bring one out.  The waiter didn't seem to enjoy working there. I think he smiled once. The pazooki was good, but not worth the wait and lack of service.

Tastebud S.,"Union City, CA",0,48,,1.0,3/18/2012,"Each and everytime I come here, whether a Tuesday afternoon, it seems to always be busy.  This business does not allow any reservation unless it's for a party of 9.  Well here is how I rate this business. It's based on location/parking, service, price, quality/taste of the food, cleanliness.  Alright here it is. Location/parking of course it's in the Tanforan Shopping Mall so parking is difficult.  I usually end up finding parking farther from the entrance and more closer to the El Camino Real street.  Service is like horrible. Waiter/waitress would try to be nice and friendly but getting them to come to your table once you have been seated takes another 10-15 minutes. So I would end up just placing all my orders and not try to order the drinks like they would normally do once they approach your table. And then the other thing was that it takes them 30 minutes to make Mac-N-Cheese for a child.  Now give me a break, it looks like the pre-packaged microwavable Mac-N-Cheese.  So why it took so long I could not tell you but I had to get the manager involve.  He too could not give me an answer as to why it took so long to get it ready, when I specifically as for it to brought to our table as soon as it was done because I had a child who was hungry. I did also mention that to them. But of course that didn't matter to there establishment.  So if you have a child who is diabetic, don't even try taking him/her here or otherwise they would end up in the hospital.  Price for what in on there menu is not at all worth the money.  I mean, come on, Mac-N-Cheeses is that even worth $6 or more?  It came slightly over microwaved because it was almost dried out of the cheese.  Quality/taste of the food, well as I mentioned already, it's not cracked up to be with what others have rated this business.  Cleanliness it one thing that is good which is why I give them this 1 star rating.  Sorry, for the being honest but I hate to read reviews and then finding out the opposite. Now other yelpers have given good ratings for a Pizookie.  Now it's not that great.  It's just a chocolate chip cookie with an ice-cream on top.  There is nothing special about that.  The twice that we have ordered this so-called pizookie, it was hard (over-cooked) cookie.  I could hardly cut it with a spoon or fork to give some to my son.  I can go on with food we have ordered that did not cut-it or even worth the time it took or the price for it.  So let's just say this is not something to brag about to someone because you might be looked upon that person as not having good taste for the right type of restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bruno?start=1740
