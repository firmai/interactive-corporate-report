The unlimited fries is also a huge plus! Especially with their special seasoning.

Joseph S.,"South Windsor, CT",53,23,1,1.0,11/15/2017,"NOW WITH MORE GUAC!!!! If I could post a title I think this is fitting. Orders the Salsa Guac appetizer and they had a burst that said ""now with more GUAC"". What we got was a spoonful. We sent it back. About 20-25 minutes later we got my burger, her bowl of chili, a kids Mac and cheese and a kids corndog. Kids meals were cold, my burger which I asked for ""some pink"" was well done. Was told we would have a manager sent over. No such case. After eating what we could of our terrible food, (Kids ate the oranges) we got our bill. Charged for untouched kids meals. Sadly we have another $25 gift certificate. Probably sell on offered up. Slow to get order and bad food. Used to be good. What happened?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester
Megan K.,"Rocky Hill, CT",297,391,1510,4.0,11/19/2017,"This Red Robin is a solid 4 establishment. Their fries are soooooo good with the fry flavoring and I can't recall anything I've never liked here. Normally I get the whiskey burger but yesterday I was more bold and tried the double taco seasoned burger and it was amazing, with a little kick thanks to the pepper jack cheese they put on it. My sweet potato fries needed to be cooked a little longer, but the mozz sticks were on point. I had their drink special, the orange cinn-a-rita, and omg it's like a delicious alcoholic sunny delight, I think that's the best comparison I can come up with for it. I highly recommend it. What really impressed me too is I went with my friend and her one year old little girl and my friend was worried about cleaning up under the baby's high chair and the waitress was super nice and said no no they'd take care of it. Which really spoke volumes, seeing as how most servers would complain about having to clean up after a little one. I'll def be back for another burger soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester
Angela M.,"Mansfield, CT",132,178,51,3.0,10/17/2016,"Stopped in after a day of shopping, around 715pm on a Saturday evening. Was told the wait was 20 minutes for 3 but it definitely was less than that.  Once seated our server was there right away. Ordered apps and waited. And waited. It was super busy but it took a while to get our appetizers (as a side note, you can get just the cheese curds, and the pretzel nuggets and cheese are good but the cheese has a very strong beer flavor).  Our server did a nice job following up with us and letting us know our food was up soon. It was a long wait (probably 30-45 minutes from when we ordered dinner to when it came) but we didn't mind much. We used a Groupon and the manager came quickly to take care of that and our check (because there's apparently been a lot of fraud?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester

Jeff H.,"Manchester, CT",60,130,348,4.0,3/19/2016,"I came here with my girlfriend after a day of hopping around the Westfarms area and we decided to stop in by here for some dinner.  It was a Sunday evening and the place seemed packed, but I guess the tables near the bar were free and open.   So, we quickly got a seat and the waitress came over.  We ordered a milkshake to share, which was quite good.  It was thick, but not so much that it would be difficult to drink with the straw.  We also ordered a couple burgers.  She got a special one from the menu that came on a brioche bun.  I got a tavern double.  The one new thing we tried was the honey bacon dipping sauce.  It looked a little odd when it came to the table, since it was cold and it looked like bacon fat had solidified around the bacon, but it was surprisingly delicious.  That, I believe, was the only sauce we thoroughly finished (but probably partly because it actually cost something).   Getting the attention of the waitress again to get the check was a little tough, but she was professional throughout, so no problems with service.  We're a fan of the bottomless fries, so we would probably come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester

All the burgers come with bottomless steak fries, but I upgraded to the onion rings for an extra $1. No brainer for me. Understand it's a chain and what the deal is here.  They really cater to families.  It's gonna be noisy and chaotic at times. If you can accept that going in,  you're gonna be fine. I actually like the burgers here.  Not great, but good in my opinion. The staff are usually pretty friendly and  accommodating and the restaurant has been renovated recently. Kids get a balloon too.

But lately every time I go there it's lackluster in all of the areas mentioned before.  Staff is not attentive. Food comes out late. Kitchen gets back up often. Lack of organization amongst the staff and their seating assignments. Patrons that arrive after us get the exact same meals before us. Inconsistency of presentation...some tables get plates with their apps, some don't. Staff don't track burgers for rewards club even when asked.

Chin M.,"West Hartford, CT",0,9,,5.0,3/27/2017,"The kids dragged me out here tonight as we have not been to Red Robin since last year.  The Buckland Mall store has been refreshed and the changes are wonderful.  I think I subconsciously stopped going there because, although they have great burgers and salads, it always seemed loud to me.  That is not the case anymore, and this was with the restaurant absolutely full with a waiting list.  The new walls and screens are fantastic for cutting down the ambient noise, we actually talked as if we were at our dining room table.   First off, the service is great and the wait staff was not hurrying us but they were certainly on top of the next things that needed to be done at the table.  Their wings have always been on a par with Wooden Tap and J. Tim's and tonight was no exception.  For the first time ever, the kids actually finished a tower of onion rings (I need to understand they are getting bigger) and still had room for their burgers.   Our burgers were great.  I really appreciate the fact they have ""adult"" burgers, burgers that are creative and different and when I want really spicy they can deliver really spicy.  The kids were all happy with their choices and particularly like the real milkshakes they get.  We laughed at the fact that we never order dessert because we are always so full from fries and shakes.   One of the nicest things was I left a really good tip and the waitress walked right out the front door to thank us and wish us a good evening.  My thought is that Red Robin has made a substantial effort to tone down the noise and turn up the service and that really worked for us tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester
Jonathan G.,"Windsor, CT",41,24,3,4.0,3/13/2017,It's a bit pricey. Burgers start around $8 and go up from there. But that's pretty much standard for this type of restaurant. The service was good.

Jazmyn E.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,26,31,2.0,12/7/2016,"So tonight I was craving a Red Robin Burger and the rest of my family decided we all wanted it for dinner so we ordered 4 burgers and 4 milkshakes. The girl on the phone let us know that it would about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, but when we got there we had to wait an additional 30 minutes just to receive our food..which was cold. Makes no sense why the food would be cold, when it ""wasn't"" ready yet. Then on top of that it took another 10 minutes for them to make our milkshakes because they decided to serve people at the bar first, although we had already been waiting for 30 minutes and PAID!!! The drinks were half way full and the manager had the nerve of saying "" that's just how its done here"", so...the way its done is by making your customers wait although they called in 30 MINUTES PRIOR, serve cold food and only give people half full drinks? WTF. What's the point of paying 3.00 for BARELY half of a cup...I'm sorry but NEVER AGAIN.

Ian Y.,"Hartford, CT",183,363,156,3.0,5/11/2016,"I don't eat out much, but when I do, I always try to give my business to a locally-owned joint.  But I get it: There are those times when the easiest ""consensus restaurant"" for a group dinner is a chain restaurant. Given that chain restaurants exist, first and foremost, for profit and not customer service (looks like my economics student bias is coming out), I don't expect much from chain restaurants; though, I don't believe it is unreasonable to expect the correct order, especially since chain restaurant menus are fairly standardized.  I ordered the crispy arctic cod ""burger"", substituting the standard sesame seed bun with a croissant (the free bun substitution, I admit, is a neat feature of Red Robin restaurants).  Unfortunately, my ""burger"" came incomplete, without the promised shredded cabbage on top of the cod fillet.  I don't know if this had to do with the fact that the croissant made the sandwich significantly harder to stack, but it was, nonetheless, disappointing to be gypted out of a complete ""burger"". Fortunately, the staff here was quite kind and accommodating with our large group, especially given the fact that I arrived much later than the rest of my group and the fact that my group unintentionally stayed through the restaurant's closing time.  And anyways, meeting friends for dinner is about the company more than the food.  This Red Robin location provided a welcoming atmosphere for a fun meal, so I really can't complain much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=20
Parlor Ghost ..,"New York, NY",82,4,3,2.0,7/10/2017,"My gf and I decided to try Red Robin's again after years of not going. I won't lie I had high hopes coming in today, seeing how this location was good when they originally opened..and they haven't closed since. We were sat quickly, not many people inside. Food came out pretty fast and drinks as well. Everything tasted ok at best. Nothing to rant and rave about. Atmosphere was kind of meh. The real reason why I am giving these guys 2 stars is because of the waiter we had. He decided while he waits on tables that he'd test out his comedy career and joke around like we were his friends. Don't get me wrong, we are really chill and down to earth but when it comes to restaurants, we just want someone quick and efficient who doesn't mess up our orders...not much to ask for right? The kicker is when he went to go and give me my card, he pretended like it got declined...then handed me the receipt to sign and said hahahaha just kidding. Obviously Red Robin is where you go to work if you're trying to become a clown.

John P.,"Manchester, CT",76,165,252,2.0,3/29/2016,"NOT as good as they used to be. My family went their to celebrate our daughter's birthday on Wednesday. It just so happen that the local Girl Scouts had a table setup immediately as you walked inside. I was immediately asked by them if I was interested in buying their cookies. I said no thank you, and a 2nd time, she asked me again??? I told her, look , we're here to celebrate my daughters birthday and not buy your cookies. How rude! To make matters worse, management allowed the Girl Scouts to put their table within 2' of where customers walk through their doors. Not on the side, which would've been a better alternative. My 7 yo, was crying at the time because her favorite video game was not there, and the last thing I needed was to be approaced immediately by the Girl Scouts. How about let the customer decide if we're interested. ???? Very poorly executed by Red Robin's Management Staff. So, that just set off a bad vibe and things got worse from there.  We sat down, our daughter noticed from the children's menu, for some odd reason , Red Robin stopped selling their famouse cheese quesidilla's. She was very upset about that too. She went with the pizza and thought it tasted disgusting. I tried some and agreed.  The best part was when the staff came over at the end of the meal to sing Happy Birthday and gave her a sundae! Which barely salvaged our dining experience.  On a side note, my burger came out fine, but my wife's salad was brought to our table without the chicken, because the waitress said it wasn't ready yet,so why bring it out? My wife was easting a plain old salad for about 5 min, until they brought out the chicken which was supposed to be the main part of the salad. Just a crazy day, and in the middle of the week with this many mistakes?? Oh, the line cooks , as I'm remembering, were unprofessional, laughing outloud and fooling around. We could even hear this from afar. At least our waitress was pretty good, though she brought out a half salad without the chicken.  This Red Robin location in Manchester, is not consistent with the way it's quality was over the years. I hope that someone from Headquarters reads this and reorganizes the way this location is running.

Gus W.,"Columbus, OH",444,489,668,3.0,1/15/2015,"I've been to this Red Robin a handful of times and have never actually had a bad meal. It's been a year or two since I've had Red Robin, since the only one close to me back in Columbus shut down. I've always enjoyed their burgers and the unlimited fries (along with the seasoning) so there isn't much to complain about. On this latest trip, I realized they've really added a lot to the menu, or least a lot more burgers. I thought they had a ton of burgers before, but it looked like they added a whole new page. I actually went with the Tavern burger, because you can 'style' it to your choosing, and I went with the 'Fiery Ghost' style, which adds their ghost pepper sauce and fried and fresh jalapenos to the burger. I think I added bacon is well, because that sounds like something I'd do. All-in-all the burger was pretty tasty, but it really wasn't all that hot, considering the way they describe it. The fries were decent, but nothing crazy good, maybe a little cold. The server was just OK, but I wasn't expecting much. The server was friendly and actually recognized our Huntington Bank card from being in the Midwest, so we chatted a bit. I'd definitely come to Red Robin more often if there was one around me, because they do provide a decent meal at a fairly cheap price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=20

I am a regular at this joint.  I wanted to place an order for to-go and called them. The call was answered and the details like my name etc. were taken. I was about to tell my order and at that point of time was put on hold. I was put on hold for about 10 minutes. When I called them again, the phone went unanswered. I eventually had to go there and place the order. When I told them my experience, they were apologetic and said they would see that my order is ready at the earliest. I did receive the order in about 5 minutes.  The customer service(or the lack of it rather) especially for the pick-up orders has been bad recently. I do hope for their own good, that they have an experienced person answering the phone calls and taking the to-go orders. I  have no complaints about the food and I think it is still pretty good.

Rob M.,"Columbia, CT",44,175,10,1.0,10/4/2014,"I just don't know what there is to get excited about. I don't generally bother to review such massive chains, but this one deserves a mention.  Boring, totally mediocre. Like, right down to the so-called famous burgers; the server asked my wife how she wanted her burger cooked. Medium rare, she replied. But the server said ""We'll try but we usually only do medium."" Huh? I had heard another server actually tell her guests that they couldn't serve anything less than medium because of liability issues. Seriously? Good to see a chain stand behind the quality of their ingredients. Well, my wife's burger came out brown throughout. Nowhere even close to medium. My guess is, the volume here is so high that they just throw a thousand burgers on the grill at one time and you get whatever is ready when your order comes up. For a restaurant that calls itself a burger joint, that's a pretty sorry-ass excuse for cooking burgers.  I had a French Dip, which was once again totally unremarkable. We paid $50 for lunch.

Hair should NEVER touch food. As our hostess sat us down, she wiped the crumbs from the table with her hands instead of legitimately cleaning it.

They used to have consistent service and I feel that the quality and service has declined considerably. We asked for a booth and they sat us in one of those 2 seater booths that could barely give you arm room to move comfortably, so that was disappointing. Perhaps we should have been more specific and asked for a booth that comfortably seats two adults? We were there this past week, and selection wise, for the burgers, I do think that they have a good selection. The fries used to be a favorite of ours and this time they (2 baskets) were both soggy.. I asked the waitress to please bring another basket and this basket (delivered 15 minutes later ) was a soggy AND stale tasting mess.  I ordered a salad and it was 95% lettuce and 5% fixins. I asked for two sides of dressing and they only delivered one.. My friend got a chicken burger and agreed that the fries were not so great.

About half the time I go to eat in or pick up takeout, the order is wrong. One time our waitress recommended that my boyfriend get the spicy BBQ sauce on the side of his (tenders or ribs can't remember), because it's so hot and people have complained. I saw her write it that way on the ticket... But when the food came out sauce was slathered all over them. She tried to go above and beyond and the kitchen messed that up.    Another time I was at a work lunch with about eight people and as our food came out one of my coworkers noticed his salad was wrong. They took the salad back and comped him for it, but by the time they brought him a new one we were all done eating. He ended up getting it to go. Terrible considering it was just a salad. I loooove their veggie burger, and my boyfriend gets the royal burger with the fried egg on top. Last time we ordered take out both the burgers were beef, and the time before that they got the toppings right but on the wrong burger.

The place was busy as usual, with balloons being filled, and kids lining up to lose their parents' money in the Claw machines...but I digress. We were sat in a reasonable amount of time. Our server came by with full hands in a few seconds, letting us know he would be right with us. Sometimes it's the little things that tilt a restaurant experience, and Mike certainly had it down. He came by and took our order, which included their Towering Onion Rings, three burgers of various sorts and a grilled chicken sandwich. The onion rings are always hot, fresh and crispy, with ranch and Baja (spicier) ranch dressings to dip. My wife ordered a mushroom Swiss burger - with sauteed onions, and no bun, and a salad instead of fries. I ordered their ""Burnin' Love"" burger, which had cayenne seasoning, pepperjack cheese, L&T, all on a corn-jalapeno bun. Amazingly good. Everything we ordered came out exactly as requested...a great time-saver for the wait-staff and cook crew, I'm sure! The fries were perfectly cooked, not greasy, and went very well with their exclusive Red Robin seasoning blend that is perched (pardon the pun) on every table. Drinks included diet sodas, for wich there were refills waiting just as we finished the last few sips. Also the signature Freckled Lemonade, with bits o' strawberry. All paled in comparison and creativity to the Guinness Shake! This was a chocolate milk shake that had the famous stout, as well as a small shot of Jameisons Irish Whisky. The combo was actually not bad, although it was so wonderfully thick it would be all but impossible to drink enough of them to catch a buzz! The crew brought out a birthday sundae for my wife, who is now &^*&* years old...haha I'll never tell!

Monkey C.,"Framingham, MA",8,62,2,5.0,9/5/2012,"This is a really good Red Robin.  Some of them stink (the one up in Enfield as a matter o fact).  Some of them are really good.  This one is one of the good ones.  Wait staff are excellent, always getting back to us, following up, then always being pleasant, accommodating and fast.  They don't malinger.  They do their job.  THANK YOU WAIT STAFF.  First off, we did not come here for years because of a raw burger snafu.  We couldn't get a burger cooked.  It kept coming out raw.  We'd send it back and they'd send another raw burger.  I don't know what that was about but it was kind of nightmarish...you'd bite in and it was okay and then bite again and the cow would moo.  Then we went home and waited for the salmonella we were sure we had eaten to set in. But we picked up a couple of groupons, and they are rated by someone as THE BEST BURGER or something so we figured we'd give them another shot.  And lo and behold, they have become amazingly uberGOOD. Frankly I wish we had picked up more, but these couple will do.  Because their service and burgers and other fried fare are superb.   Last night I had a fish and chips with a few shrimp thrown in that was unreal good. I'm not saying the shrimp or the fish were of exceptional quality.  They were typical, but they were fried to perfection!   PLUS before that we had other fried items as our appetizers: onions rings and cheese sticks.  LOTS of them.  They give you lots.  And you eat it all because it's delicious.  And the sauces you dip this stuff into are even more delicious.   The classic burger, whatever they call it is out of this world.  I like the one with the sweated onions, but I don't like bread so I have them put it on lettuce.  Between all the perfectly cooked, delicious meat and cheese and really fresh lettuce and firm sliced tomatoes and sauces, not to mention fantabulous endless fries, I have died and gone to heaven.  Or will just that much sooner because no doubt this isn't exactly good for you, unless you're badly in need of a fat injection.   But no one going to a burger joint really cares about those things.  At least I don't. BTW, I gave it five stars because THIS is what I want from a burger joint! Juicy burgers made with delicous meat and delectable fried other stuff.  And exactly the right amount of attention from their staff.   I have to chuckle at anyone who might consider ordering a salad as their entre at Red Robin.  You are there to laugh at death!  And death laughs back!

My girlfriend and I stopped here as it was a good meeting point between myself and someone I was selling car parts to.

I noticed that the other patio tables were waited on fairly often, yet ours didn't get that same attention. Once we were done eating and were ready to pay, we had to wait a while before the check was even delivered. I noticed that our server was also working behind the bar.

Jenny F.,"North Haven, CT",65,380,378,4.0,5/5/2008,"After a day of running errands we decided to try Red Robin.  Mike and I reasoned that if we tried Red Robin we would have someplace new to Yelp about. We arrived at an in between time around 2:30 or so.  The restaurant wasn't very busy at this time.  Our waitress came right over and took our drink order.  We took a few minutes to read over the menu and decide on burgers.   I ordered the Banzai burger which had terriyaki sauce and grilled pineapple.  I ordered it well done which I have to do because I am pregnant!  It came out well done but still juicy not the normal charcoaled hockey puck that I was expecting. They even remembered that I said no mayo which is a plus! The size of the burger was big but not sickeningly so.  The steak fries are bottomless but that didn't matter to me because I am not a fan and did not touch them.  My husband said they were pretty good. The burgers were pretty good for a chain place.   Our waitress was helpful, friendly, and quick.

Derek S.,"North Haven, CT",24,21,2,1.0,7/2/2010,"One star for food and nothing else. I would actually give this two stars if there hadn't been so many idiots giving this place 4 and 5 stars. read my review, then look at what the other ""reviewers"" said about the place and they will fall into one or more of these categories: -Don't typically like fast food -Don't typically like greasy food -Don't typically like chain restaurants -Complained about the noise -Complained about the service -Complained about the kids This is consistent with the 4 and 5 star reviews. The food is pretty good, but not good enough to excuse all these problems, which seem to happen pretty regularly. They should have been rated 3 stars at best. Two reviewers were friends and they got free food for no reason. I disregard Jenny F.'s reviews. I've eaten at a number of RRs in many different parts of the country. Indeed, the food is pretty damn good and I've never eaten a bad meal there. I've gotten take-out most times, so maybe I've always been able to enjoy the food and never have to put up with the actual in-restaurant facets. That being said, in order to get the endless fries, you must eat in, which is ironic considering the fact that the dining-in experience is so awful, they need to bribe you with all the fries you could ever eat in order to pacify you. I went on a Thursday night at 6:30pm, with 5 people. The restaurant was crowded when we arrived, but quickly became half full. Peak hour had just ended.  The sound quality is atrocious. Without the restaurant even being full, I could barely make out what the person right next to me was saying. We were also seated in the middle of the main section, which didn't help either. Either way, despite the number of people, the restaurant was LOUD and BUSY. There were many parents with their kids, some of them for an odd middle-of-the-week birthday party. There are also loud televisions all competing for the attention of the patrons. I can only blame this on poor design of the restaurant. No place should be THIS loud. Also, for some reason, the kitchen staff were busing dishes though the restaurant, even going right by our table on their regular route. This happened a dozen times in the hour we were there, so it was no accident. The kitchen staff typically stays out of sight from the patrons, but apparently this is part of the allure. So even with good food, I would not go back for the design and the noise alone, now if only the service were OK, it would get two stars... Our waiter was Tim and he acted like a clown from the beginning; and when I say ""clown,"" I mean he hammed everything up for the kids and my mom in order to get tips for being silly. And, like most clowns, I was not amused and slightly petrified. Once he actually tried acting like a waiter, he took our drink order and brought our drinks.  I have no complaint about his refilling of drinks over bringing over the food, though he DID fill our drinks completely with ice, which meant we all needed 2 or 3 refills. Maybe he could have been a better waiter had he given us half as much ice and, thus, exert half the effort to refill our drinks. Also, he put our straws in front of one of us, who had to pass them around. Just hand each of us a straw, jackass! If it is a 16-person party and you need to put 8 straws on each end, then find, but stop making us work! After our drinks arrived, he gave us one minute to open the menu, then asked if we were ready. We weren't, so he went away for ten minutes and then came back. I really hate it when waiters think you either know what you are getting, or will need a half hour to decide. They should be gone no more than 5 minutes, or at least remain in the area for when we are looking around for them. Once he took our menus, we noticed the table had never been cleaned off from the previous party. Actually, we were at one of those expandable tables that are square for 4 people, then there are rounded sections underneath that swing up to make it a circle. The square section was more or less clean, but the circular half was still dirty. Whatever. The food server brought our food (and I hate dealing with servers [unless you are with a big party and they are just helping the waiter] since the waiter took our order and should be giving us our meals) and we had to wait for Timmy the Clown to come by in order to give us napkins and silverware. We had been there 20 minutes and they were never put on the table. My mom noticed that she and I didn't get our fries with our meals. We called over the court jester and she asked for the fries, to which he said, ""Oh f...fries, w...we got fries"" and ran off to get our fries. Yeah, those endless fries are a real treat. As we were finishing dinner he put the check on our table without even asking if we wanted dessert. We felt real special. He never came by to take our debit card and another waiter ran it for us. 10% tip. I'm never coming back to this RR and will try the West Hartford one next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=80

We ordered 3 burgers (whiskey, guac/bacon, & santa fe), 1 ragin' cajun chicken sandwich, and 2 orders of wings. Here are where the problems start: 2 of sandwiches were ordered w/o Mayo, mayo was still applied to all of them. They all were crushed, and looked like the cook just slapped them together and mashed the bun down. All the fries were cold and soggy. It was less than a 5 min drive home, and the food wasn't ready when we got there after waiting the prescribed amount of time we were given on the phone. Overall we were very displeased with the quality and control of the $60+ order. We would have gone back to have the other two sandwiches fixed but after looking at how poorly they were all put together we decided against it. 2 of the 4 people went without eating, and the other 2 did not enjoy their lack luster burger and substandard fries.

Evan G.,"New York, NY",45,332,35,5.0,2/8/2009,"I went to Red Robin last night for the first time in years, and was blown away. I always liked going to Red Robin, but the person I was with at the time hated it, so alas its been a while.  I received a free birthday dinner coupon so we decided we needed to check it out. Since me and the girl are keeping kosher you cannot have dairy products after meat, but you can have it before them. Due to this we strangely asked the waiter to bring us the free birthday sundae first, which he did without even questioning us, which was really cool. The food took a little while to come out, but our waiter was super nice and apologized to us a lot because of it, so he brought us out a basket of fries to hold us over until the food came. It was funny because the girl had just mentioned that the one in Nebraska always does that, no matter what, which is a pretty cool gesture. The other thing that was nice was its for a free gourmet burger, which to me meant it was going to be a hamburger. Apparently I was wrong, they classify everything as a burger basically. You can even get a chicken or fish or turkey sandwich for free. In the end we got the sundae, 2 burgers, tons of fries and the bill was $9.

Jon S.,"South Windsor, CT",1,18,6,2.0,6/27/2011,"I like Red Robin. This one location is not one I care for.  On our most recent trip we experienced a waitress who was short, curt, and inattentive. This was not from having to many tables, she just didn't seem to care.  My son got a squeezed lemon wedge in his apple wedges. I know that lemon can slow the browning of a cut apple, but we've never come across the squeezed lemon wedge left under the apples. My son was concerned he got ""used"" apple wedges. Begrudgingly the waitress replaced the wedges, but the new ones were so coated in lemon juice it was all you could taste. He would not eat any more of his meal at all then worried that more of it was ""used"".  When we could get refills on our drinks my wife's glass came with a crack and a large chip in the rim. Cleaning up while waiting for the waitress to return from where ever she disappeared to I found my basket had ketchup in it under the wax paper, Gross.  I wrote to the email address on the receipt and told them of my experiences at lunch that day. In 2 weeks I have not gotten a reply of any kind, so I'm presuming they do not care.

Chaviva G.,"Denver, CO",407,298,140,4.0,2/8/2009,"For my second-ever trek to a Red Robin (the first being in lovely Lincoln, Nebraska), I'm sold. Call me a customer for life. Yes, it's a chain restaurant, and yes, it's one of those kitschy places that you take your 4-year-old for kicks and giggles, but it's also some darn good food. You can read Evan's review for WHY we were there, but with a free meal coupon plus a free ice cream, we couldn't not go. Our total bill only came out to about $9, and that was for my burger and fries.  The waiter seemed a little off, but he turned out to be a really great server. We asked for our ice cream first so we could get our dairy done before the meat, and he didn't even bat an eyelash. The sundae came out, the server took our order -- I got the 5 Alarm Burger (Crank up the heat with Pepper-Jack cheese, jalapeños, fresh tangy salsa, sliced tomato, crisp lettuce and Chipotle mayo) without the cheese, of course. The burger likened to the deliciousness of the burgers of Kuma's in Chicago, IL, which is very hard to match up with. It came with a bottomless basket of fries, too, and their fries are outstanding. So our food was delayed, so they brought us out a basket of fries with the special sauce that they serve with the onion rings and THAT was good. The food finally came and everything was outstanding. Perhaps the best part, though, was when the waiter came over to us with the menu and asked us if we wanted to get an appetizer now that we were working the menu backwards. Hilarity ensued! The only downfall to this joint was a bizarre smell that it seemed only I could smell. It rang of ... cleaning or a bathroom or something bizarre like that, but once the food came out?

We had waters with lemon for dinner, not once did we get a refill (even after asking). My burger was supposed to have mayo on it, it had none.

B) they have an outdoor patio...that is covered (granted there's alot of car fumes and people walking by you...but still) Prices...fine... Clean?  yeah sure...its clean The crowds tend to be on the young side (can be very loud at times) but I think families make up the biggest group.  Great place just to chill with the friends and its okay to be older than 18 and chill here.  Dates?  hmm...you would need to be going out for a year or so...not a ""first"" date type of venue.  Elderly?  Probably too loud for them.   Would definitely choose this over McDonalds if you want a hamburger AND have the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=100

Elizabeth M.,"Bellingham, WA",3,19,3,4.0,8/28/2008,"OK let me start by saying that I do not typically like chain restaurants, especially ones that have tacky, cheesy decor like RR.  However, my husband and I continue to to go back here because they make great burgers and chicken burgers, the fries are also good.  The only other thing on the menu we ever get is the deep fried zucchini appetizer, wow, its yummy!  Super fresh and hot with light batter, sprinkled with parm cheese and creamy ranch to dip them them in.  As for the other menu items, don't bother, if you want pasta go to an Italian restaurant, this is a burger place.  The atmosphere is loud and obnoxious, there are always kid's birthday parties going on and bad music playing.  We always joke about what a ""romantic"" place is it for the two of us newlyweds to go to.  The service is good 75% of the time. There is one particular waiter (I wish I knew his name) who is OUTSTANDING.  He is tall and skinny and obviously a bit older than the usual college kids who work there.  We always try to sit in his section.  Something else to note, you can sign-up on the RR website for their birthday club and get a coupon e-mailed to you for a free ""Birthday Burger"".  Its great place to go before or after a shopping trip to the Buckland Hills area and a really great place if you have kids, just be aware that that weekend afternoons are super crazy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=100
