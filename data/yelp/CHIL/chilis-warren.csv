Jordan L.,"Saline, MI",180,8,1,1.0,1/1/2015,"This restaurant needs help. Worst experience in a corporated food service chain. Management sucks!!!! The service was complaining to us on how busy they were and backed up rather than servicing us in the right way, the restaurant was at 25% capacity. CAUTION!!! Expect to get a fucking greasy plate... They brought out appetizers and sides after our entree. We waited for our drink refills for 20min. There's soooo much more, choose a different place, don't go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Brandon R.,"Utica, MI",7,3,1,1.0,6/17/2014,Was served my chicken salad on a dirty plate. Not to mention the couple bites I did take before noticing the plate. The salad was limp with brown on the ends. Sorry to say this is a very poor managed establishment. Additionally when I arrived for lunch almost all the tables had been neglected with with dirty dishes from customers that they hadn't bothered to clean. They definitely were not busy enough for the restaurant  to be in such disarray.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Debbie Z.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",284,278,51,3.0,1/27/2014,Went here after a funeral - another one!  Ugh.  Nothing great about this restaurant - food was about average - a C I would say.  Everything was just alright.  Probably will not go back because it was not monumental at all! Parking was convenient. The waitress had an attitude. Oh well.  Won't be back Chili's sorry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Matthew K.,"South Lyon, MI",25,306,26,4.0,5/15/2013,"Better than Applebees (at least, when comparing the Warren locations).  But still high calorie, high fat food.  Although some of their under-500 calories dishes looked appealing, it's a shame they're over $10 for a lunch when you can get a filling (albeit calorie dense) lunch for $6 off their specials menu.  It's pretty obvious they're catering to the fat crowd, which is a shame. I ordered the Guacamole burger and my wife ordered the quesadilla lunch special with the loaded potato soup.  We enjoyed the food, although my burger was already getting soggy by the time it was delivered.  We had a free dessert coupon and went for the molten fudge cake w/ice cream.  A 1000 calorie monster!  Which I'm ashamed to say we finished, haha! I've never had bad service at this Chilis, and the food is at least consistently good.  I couldn't handle going here more than once every few months, but it's a guilty pleasure we like hitting up occasionally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Ian C.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",6,5,,2.0,6/16/2014,"This place is soooo slow! I got in around 9:20 and placed a carryout order and 35 minutes later I'm still waiting. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the food tastes better than the average Chili's. The bartender, Robin, is polite but definitely takes her time getting anything you ask for and randomly disappears for several minutes without checking on anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Brooke B.,"Auburn Hills, MI",1,8,,1.0,8/19/2014,"My server was good but I thought the place was disgusting it was filthy.. everywhere I looked there was filth; there was food all over my silverware and my skillet handles, the screens that you got to play with mind you you get automatically get charged .99 those were filthy the bathrooms are disgusting and the food wasn't really that good the only thing that was pleasant was the server I don't think I'll be back,, no I know I won't be back the portions were so small even though it was 20.00 it was so small,, I was beyond disappointed...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
T S.,"Warren, MI",0,3,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Experienced angry manager who went from 0 to 100 hollering & yelling at me because I told her what was wrong with my to go order (burnt food,way smaller portions than other Chili's,zero sauce on chicken) and refused to pay if it wasn't made correctly. She ORDERED me to pay or she would call the police, then she flipped again & told me to get out & never come back all over $30 worth of food they made wrong. I was amazed at the emotional roller coaster the leader of this place went on in all of 5 minutes in response to easy to fix problems. While waiting a long time for the food to be brought out (even though it was almost empty in there, & the order had been called in over 30 minutes prior) I witnessed the bar staff put sudsy glasses on the bar to dry, a waitress scoop fries from a bin of fries onto a customers plate without wearing gloves, & a different manager roll her eyes and trash talk with waitresses about another customer who also complained of poorly made food. I now know why it was so empty at dinner time on a weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
M L.,"Warren, MI",0,6,2,1.0,3/27/2015,"Poor service & horrible food!! Walked in...the restaurant was pretty empty...there were 3 parties waiting for a table and no one was to be found....that should've been our red flag, but we stuck around....alcoholic beverages were just okay. All the food we ordered.....nothing hit the spot. Waitress got mad when we mentioned the beer we ordered tasted funky and watered down. Just overall horrible. We were there less than 20 minutes and left irritated...as we were walking out, a customer was complaining to her buddies ""the drinks suck, food doesn't taste good and service sucks!"" Took the words right out of my mouth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Alan M.,"Warren, MI",0,4,,1.0,2/16/2015,Decided to give them another chance and tried to order some carry out online and it said to please call the restaurant. I call the restaurant and it directs me to press 1 for carry out so I do so. The girl answers and I tell her I would like to order a carry out. She transfers me to carry out (what's the point of pressing 1!) Where I proceed to wait about 7 minutes with no response.  Ended up at Qdoba. Glad to see they have made efforts to improve thier service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Teresa G.,"Warren, MI",1,27,7,1.0,9/30/2014,"Took my family to what I thought would be a nice dinner out and was sorely mistaken. The entire experience, from the waitress to the food, was just horrible. The kitchen couldn't get the kids cheeseburger bites right - probably the easiest thing on the menu - they arrived with no cheese and the wrong side! That was a testament to the quality of what we received,  3 of the 4 meals that were ordered had to be sent back. My husband and I had cold meat and potatoes and RAW, hard-as-a-rock broccoli ... our waitress had to reenter the orders so that the kitchen would remake them and then didn't bother having them removed from our check until I pointed  it out so - had I not checked before handing over my credit card - I'd be paying $81 instead of $57. Talked to the manager, who only offered us one dessert or salad or soup while we waited for the kitchen to take a 2nd try at cooking correctly. Very insulting that no % was taken off the bill for poor quality food and experience and instead we were offered things we didn't order. Very slow night, we should have felt like royalty but instead felt anything but... $57 for very poor food and service, what a waste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Mike L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",1,3,,2.0,12/25/2014,"I love me some Chili's. I can't even count the number of times I've gone. But this Chili's on Mound is just awful. The food is normally always delicious, no problems there. By biggest problem is the fact that three separate times now we have waited in the lobby for over FIVE minutes without anyone greeting us! I've already walked out once because of it. But this last time we waited, and five minutes later, the hostess decides to show up and act like nothing is wrong. You have 5 groups just standing around in your lobby blocking the door because no one knows what's going on! I can understand running to go get something or taking a break, but if you do that, can't you have someone else watch the front for you? Completely ridiculous. If you can, I recommend the one on Gratiot. Amazing service there. No matter which one you go to, you'll get amazing food, but if you like to be seated promptly and without attitude, you'll avoid this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40

Justin H.,"Warren, MI",5,10,,1.0,4/24/2012,"Went there twice. The first time we had about 6 people for a birthday party. It was not busy at all and they took forever to get us drinks, appetizers, and our food. We thought it would be quick and it took us 2 1/2 hours! Terrible service!! Then we went last night. We only had 3 people. They sat us, again not busy, and we waited and waited and waited. We sat there for 30 minutes, ask 4 times for a server, which passed us multiple times, and finally got up and left. The hostess that sat us acted like we had eat already... I will never go there ever again. Usually didn't have bad servers in the past but they have lost my family and friends business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40
Christopher M.,"Center Line, MI",4,27,54,1.0,7/22/2016,"I have been to this location numerous times, and it has always been horrible. From the time it takes to be greeted at the door, the greeting from the waiter/waitress and the time it takes to receive our orders. Everytime I come and have a bad experience here, I wait a good 6 months in hopes they got rid of the horrible servers. Needless to say, it doesn't work. This last time was the last time I get ignored and forgotten about. The waitress not only took 15 mins to even greet us, but also forgot about part of my order and wasn't seen again until my food was eaten. I also went the entire meal with an empty glass. Never checked on us, and spent the entire time in the kitchen chit chatting with staff. I'll find myself a new location. Two thumbs way, way down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
Chantel S.,"Macomb, MI",0,27,7,1.0,1/23/2017,Probably one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a Chilis. Ordered lunch and took 15 minutes to receive my salad. The place was almost empty at 1 pm. The salad wasn't fresh. I couldn't even let the waitress know since she took the order and never came back to check up on me plus The waitress had an attitude. I didn't receive a refill on my beverage. Worst customer service ever. Too many restaurants out there to come back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
Sandra C.,"Warren, MI",70,150,169,4.0,5/4/2016,"What a great surprise when we went to Chili's at 12 Mile and Mound in Warren, MI for lunch today. We are regulars at this restaurant because it is close to where my sister-in-law works. My ratings have taken a dive over that last few years because of the menu changes, especially the horrible rice. I sure wish they would change it. But what you need to know is that you can substitute another side dish for the rice. You never have to eat it again. Sorry, I got off track. Today's lunch was PERFECT in every way. We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu and had Margarita Chicken. We substituted the horrible rice with mashed potatoes and the black beans with broccoli. We ordered guacamole and chips for our appetizer, which also comes as part of the 2 for $20 deal. Every single thing was made to perfection. The chips were fresh, not too salty, and not greasy. The guacamole excited my sense of taste. We loved it! The chicken was so tender you could cut it with your fork and seasoned wonderfully. The mashed potatoes and broccoli were great, too. Best meal I have had there in a couple of years. I asked to speak to Angela Ferris, the manager. She came out and I told her today's meal was perfect and I asked who prepared our entrees in the kitchen. Sue made the guacamole and worked the prep station. Markus and Nino were the cooks of that outstanding chicken, mashed potatoes and broccoli. Kudos to the three of them. I raised my score from a 2 to a 4 because of today and I hope to receive more great food from this particular team of employees. Usually, we go there Tuesdays, but had to change to Wednesdays this week. I think it will be Wednesdays from now on if that is when Sue, Markus, and Nino are scheduled to work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
M T.,"Warren, MI",2,30,,4.0,5/9/2016,"We had avoided this place for the past year because of a somewhat bad experience.  However, we finally gave it another shot, and it was fine.  The food was very good, our server was attentive, and the place seemed clean.  My only complaint is that my first drink took a very long time to arrive from the bar, but my second drink arrived promptly.  We will be coming back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
Amanda L.,"Warren, MI",30,20,49,1.0,10/10/2015,"If I visit another Chilis After this experience, it will not be this location. Bad service, uncleanly environment, low class clientele, very very lengthy ticket time, very small portions OR over priced for what your getting, for example; My Margarita Bowl was very very small (mostly black beans, ton of black beans), and that portion would make sense if the salad was $6.99, but for what I paid, the portion should have been much greater. The salad bowl lacked greens and there was hardly any chicken on it, it was mostly beans and rice, but mostly beans, so many beans I had to scoop out 3-4 spoonfuls to be able to taste any other flavors in the mix! My sons burger was cold and the side of fries was minimal at best, also cold. My friend got chicken fajitas, and those were a joke! Small portions, hardley authentic, the grilled peppers were basically raw vegetables. A side plate of Pico, cheese, guac n sour cream accompanied the very small entree, but no shredded lettuce, and when i say cheese, i mean like a pinch of cheese, like a flick, like crumbs.... I took a picture of all the food before we ate any of it, so u can see how the food actually was served to us. The Server didn't check on us throughout our extended stay, didn't even refill obvious empty drinks until she was asked, and than left the empty cups on our table rather than remove them. Servers walk past dirty tables and allow them to remain covered in food and plates for you to look at while eating. I'm a waitress, I know what I'm talking about, this dining experience was A JOKE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
Lucas D.,"Canton, MI",0,4,,1.0,3/26/2015,"Let's start with the extremely poor service, and the poor wait staff. After it took almost an hour for our food, everyone's order was screwed up. The worst part of it all, my buddy had an 8 inch hair in his salad. When we advised the staff of the issue, they gave him a new one that looked like it was sitting in a cooler for a few days. To top it off, they only took half off his bill. I like refills on drinks, but good god man, they wasted so much on us when we weren't even finished with the first drink.  The whole electronic e bill is kinda cool. But I am old school, bring me my bill so I can pay you cash. They appeared to be upset when I asked for the bill. The whole experience stunk. After seeing my buddy pull a hair out of his salad it kinda ruined my appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
Joseph L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",1,28,47,4.0,5/17/2015,"The food was really good. I suggest the Fajitas! Everything was overall good. The interior design looks cool, the food is delicious, the ordering kiosk (where you can order on a tablet from your table and pay at your table) is convenient.

Brian S.,"Utica, MI",17,102,61,2.0,8/30/2013,"I've had multiple bad experiences at this particular location.  I work close by and it's a convenient location to grab lunch.  If you have a couple hours set aside (and like your food somewhat ok), I guess this place would get a 5 star rating every time. The thing that puzzles me with this place is that it's never overly busy when I'm in there.  The waitresses disappear for long periods of time.  The service is INCREDIBLY SLOW.  One time they didn't even have certain items that were on the menu.  That particular day the credit card machine was down.

B W.,"Mount Clemens, MI",0,46,1,3.0,11/26/2016,"I went here at lunch time during the week. It was crowded with the GM Tech Center right across the street. I was greeted immediately and showed to a booth adjacent to the bar area. The waitress came over and asked for my drink order. I said just an ice water for now. She brought me an ice tea instead,  so I politely said , "" Just water will be fine"". She brought me back a water, so no big deal. Now this ifs the first time in a Chilis restaurant in at least 15 years for me. At that time I am certain I had some sort of Tex/Mex entrée.   I recently  saw some of their advertising and marketing materials that boasted how wonderful their burgers were. I never would have thought about chilis for a burger, but I had been on the hunt for a decent burger lately and was really looking forward to trying one. After looking over the menu Guacamole Burger sounder like a match for my cravings. Don't recall ever having Guac on a burger before. It came with French frys so I decided that would be good too. The frys came out first. (And it took a while). They were cold. I sent them back asking for some hot ones. They immediately brought me some fresh ones that were actually pretty good. The burger came out and my first impression was , damn that's small...especially for $10 bucks. I cut it in half. Ate the one half in about 3 bites. It was pretty good but a bit salty. Ate a few frys and then the other half. Oh, by now my water was gone and alas, so was my waitress. When I finally saw her she came out went to a different table looked right at me and went on her merry little way. I finally hailed down another waitress who went right over to this ""waitress sub station"" gtabbed a pitcher of water and a fresh glass for me. I watched my waitress walk right by this same area when she looked in my direction with my empty glass on the table. Oh, well...now that would have been to easy to satisfy me and secure her tip. I thanked the other gal for helping and asked if I pay up front or at the table. She said my waitress would be right there to take it up. After I imagine another 5 or 6 long minutes, the other helpful one came back took my money and brought back my change.  I really wanted to give a good review so my three stars may be a bit generous. I left a meager tip. I was in a good mood so they got the benefit of that .I guess I got to thinking that maybe I am being to harsh of a judge.  Unfortunately it did not leave me with that burning desire to return. Oh, well...maybe in another 15 years or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20
Christina K.,"Warren, MI",4,14,10,1.0,6/17/2014,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This location SUCKS! The waitresses are terrible. The food takes forever. Drinks are never refilled. Food is usually like warm and cold. Managers take for freaking ever to come to the table when asked for.  I don't know why my family and I ever come back to this location.

Natalie took our drink orders and they were there on the table with in the next 2 minutes. Ordered chips and salsa (a MUST buy) were on the table with in two minutes. Chips were nice and warm and fresh, Salsa was mild, just like this gringo likes it.  Prime rib burrito was supreme-beef was tasty and tender.

Rachel F.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",145,34,44,3.0,5/28/2014,"Of course the food is always the same. Which isn't the issue. The issue is the waitstaff. They now have these hi-tech monitors at every table that is able to take your food order after the waitress takes your drink order. So it's hard to get that personable feel from the person who is making sure your food is made properly and brought to you as soon as it's hot and ready. I tested how this new device would change how they interact with people. So, I didn't use it at all. NOTHING. It took a half hour for someone to come and ask me if I had placed an order or not.

Destynie L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",104,6,2,1.0,6/2/2015,"My boyfriend and I went there for dinner last night. Horrible to say the least. The host sat us and proceeded to wipe the excess corn from the last table with our menus. Then we sat there for at least 4-5 minutes before the bartender came over and talked to us. I believe her name was Robbie?! Now being that my boyfriend is a chef and I'm a server at Comerica park, we know how the business is ran. We ordered our drinks and he was given a glass with a huge chip in the top. Seriously almost cut his finger on it. We order an appetizer which was actually good. Then about 3-4 minutes later we put our order in. Then about 35-40 minutes later I see the bartender (we were seated on the bar side so she was also our server) who never left behind the bar, ask two different people to see if our food was up. Then finally with the second woman our food came out. She slammed my plate down so hard my boyfriend and I both were shocked. We then noticed our plates and food were steaming hot and untouchable because our food sat in the window so long they popped it in the oven. With my boyfriend being a chef he knows these things.

I spotted this from the road, so we pulled in and went inside.  Oddly enough, we thought they weren't open yet because no one was here yet, but we were lucky enough to see that not only were they open, but we were the first patrons there. Hooray!!!!   Our server was a real nice gal who was friendly and nice.  Melvin hasn't been to Chili's in a long time and wasn't sure what to get, so between myself and the server, he was able to pick something out from the menu.  I went with the triple sampler, which is one of the dishes that I like to get when eating here because of the variety and price.  Melvin went with a steak (sirloin?) burrito and we both really enjoyed our time here.  Now, I'm sure it's a different crowd here depending on when you go here, but overall, it was a really good experience.  Would totally return in the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Scott P.,"Warren, MI",0,28,8,1.0,5/6/2017,"So you have a 6 top and a 3 top with people waiting to be seated. Asked the hostess why no one else is being seated. She said they are not seating to give the staff a break. They are over worked. WTF? Now I've heard it all 25 people waiting and I see a 6 top, 4 top, 2 top open. But you don't want to be too busy? Does corporate know you are doing this? Update. The kitchen is overwhelmed. I just asked if we sit in the bar area. They are not letting anyone sit down. I think I see a manager now. Now we have a another 4 top open. Seated finally after asking multiple people and explaining to the people walking in that their is a wait even though there are open tables. Finally seated after working the door lol.  Food was ok. But you get one star for not being able to handle your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Gina I.,"Grosse Pointe Woods, MI",286,186,51,5.0,4/20/2017,"I'm honestly shocked that there are literally no reviews giving 4 or 5 stars. I love Chilis! I have been here (to this location) a few times and I was just here tonight, too. My BFF and I came in here for a dessert date! Our hostess told us there was a fifteen minute wait. She was very apologetic. My friend is pregnant so I looked behind us and there were booths for people waiting to be seated. I was like, ""No problem! We will be over there taking a seat."" The wait ended up being a lot less than fifteen minutes. Yay! It seemed like they just needed a few minutes to buss tables. No big deal. We sat down and were so impressed with the menu, we decided to order food and dessert. Our server was such a cutie:) He was very friendly, attentive, and was informative, as well. The food and dessert were amazing! We ordered chips and salsa, bacon ranch steak quesadillas, a chocolate chip skillet cookie, and an Oreo lava cake. We had a wonderful experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Dean V.,"Warren, MI",49,51,63,4.0,5/9/2016,"After a one year boycott of this establishment, I decided it was time to give Chili's another try.  I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, drinks still took too long to come to the table; however our wait person was friendly and competent. The food was good too. Yes, I expected my fajitas to be sizzling when they came to the table; but the food was plenty hot.  It was close to three stars but then the waitress asked if we wanted any chips and salsa to go. Four stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Christine H.,"Warren, MI",0,23,4,1.0,4/22/2017,"Dirty!!!! Dirty silverware, a bag of used silverware, floaties in our water, and the table was sticky. People all around us were returning their plates to the kitchen.  Our order wasn't exact to how we ordered either.  We paid with a gift card and it still wasn't worth the trip.  Beware of this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Blake W.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",2,94,5,1.0,3/6/2017,Avoid this place at all costs unless you have no time constraints and plenty of patience. The food is good and that deserves 2 stars but the amount of frustration you go through brings this place down to 1 star at best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Joshua M.,"Warren, MI",65,57,421,2.0,6/21/2016,So today I came to Chilis with my wife. This place is normally good. But since we've sat down at the table in the empty restaurant. Service is less than desirable. The guacamole was lacking in the taste department. The food was slow and cold.  you let me down Chilis.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
James K.,"Livonia, MI",0,23,,1.0,8/2/2017,"The service was very good. The food....simply awful. There were 7 of us in for lunch and every dish was uniformly a mess. Gummy, greasy underfried chips, tasteless salsa, doughy, greasy quesadillas, over-salted bland soup, sad, old salad, tasteless dressing, limp cold french fries and don't even get me started on the cold, tasteless doughy tacos. It is obvious that their solution to trying to make something taste good is to dump cheese on top of it and hope for the best. It doesn't work. This restaurant is the epitome of what goes wrong with sit down chain restaurants. It has been 10 years since I ate at a Chilis.........Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Linda S.,"Dearborn, MI",0,4,,1.0,8/21/2017,Service was slow and food was cold. Horribly understaffed for a Friday lunch.  I have tried this location several times and it has never failed to disappoint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Davita B.,"Hazel Park, MI",35,2,,1.0,3/10/2017,I had the worst service from this chills I will never ever come back. Been waiting for manager for 30 mins. Restaurant is empty Manager came out unprofessional worst place ever total bullsit,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Shavon M.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",0,12,15,1.0,12/30/2016,The manager was totally unprofessional. Customer service is not respected at this establishment. I would recommend that you not waste your time or money at this Chillis. If I could give it a negative star I would.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Megan R.,"Warren, MI",94,60,2,2.0,10/14/2016,"We stop here every once in a while, and it's a sometimes hit, mostly miss for me. My fiancé likes chilis, so I normally just suck it up and go. The last time we went with our friends, they had to send their steaks back 3 times in order for them to be cooked properly. The service is always good, the staff is friendly and they do their best, it's just the food that always leaves me disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Sara B.,"Roseville, MI",0,3,,2.0,5/30/2017,"I came in by myself and sat in the bar area. I was greeted and told I would have two servers taking care of me today. The same women took my order and brought my food out. That was all the service I was good enough to get. No drink refill even though before my meal arrived I needed more water. I ordered fajitas and ran out of pitas and wanted to to order more, nope. I had so much food left I couldn't even make a fajita I had to eat everything separately. No one ever came back to ask how my meal was or if I wanted a box or dessert. I finally just gave up and paid on the Zoask and left. The best part of all of this is I listen the whole time as the bartender took care of three guys. She did an amazing job with them! I hope their tip was worth my terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Renee S.,"Hazel Park, MI",0,6,1,1.0,9/16/2017,"my fiance and I just left this place and let me start by saying this was our first time back in almost a year because the service WAS HORRIBLE  and the food was wrong not 1x but 2 times we never got our drinkd filled until we were almost done with our food needless to say we payed our bill and left....now almost a year later we wanted to give it another shot HORRIBLE  idea we walked in, our hostess walked away so we didn't see where we were sitting until she waved at us then we sit and wait and wait then we finally see our server she asks us what we want to drink we both ask for water and a tall and short draft of miller light...we wait and wait and wait then get ur water still waiting another 10-12 for our beer and chips the beer was flat and the chips were chewy  our waitress stated that the drink ticket  didn't go through because of a paper jam) my order of shrimp and chicken fajitas was horrible the chicken wasn't cooked long enough and the shrimp was chewy  and cold to the touch we told our waitress and she took it off of our bill but that was not the point I really wanted to like this place but both times prove me wrong we will not be back again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Paul M.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,40,,1.0,5/18/2016,"The last time I patronized this place-about 4 months ago-the table charge card reader was not operating. So the waitress took all our cards/bills ostensibly to the register. Low and behold, I got a call from Visa a couple days later with a Fraud warning-somebody had purchased some cellphone time in two separate charges to the tune of around $ 500.00. I called Chili's and spoke with the manager and he apologized in a matter of fact manner. I couldn't remember the server's name and didn't want to identify the wrong person by mistake, so I let it go. I am 99% sure the fraud was committed by somebody at Chili's. I recognize this can happen anywhere in this day and age, but I was surprised it happened at a fast-food chain like Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
Valerie T.,"Memphis, TN",0,4,1,1.0,6/8/2017,"Here from out of town.While eating at this restaurant today I felt a small sting on my leg. I didn't stop eating but suddenly I began scratching my leg.  Well I had some type of bite. From  what I don't know. I ended  up moving from the booth and sat at the bar to finish my meal. I had a huge fresh localized whelp on my right leg. The staff was somewhat concerned. I asked for ice to stop the itching and swelling. I was given that right away. As I held an ice bag with one hand finished my meal with the other I asked the young lady at the bar did she tell the manager. She replied yes, ""he say it must have been a mosquito"". She also said he was on the grill. I guess that meant cooking. Well it may have been or may not have been a mosquito. The fact was I was bit by  something while I sat at that booth. There was food and trash on the floor at the booth so there is no telling what it was flying or lurking around under that booth top. So a few moments later they sat a couple at that same booth with the same food and trash on the floor. I told the lady  at the bar I feel before they sat anyone else in that spot they needed to sweep that area and clean it of  the food and trash that's on the floor. She was nice and agreed with me. So when I got ready to leave I said to her you know  I'm not looking for anything free or anything but I feel it was very inconsiderate for the manager not to come out and at least check on me or see if it was something other than a mosquito that bit me. Needless to say I won't go back there again. Oh and it wasn't that busy that after each  customer the table tops as well as the surrounding floor area with trash and food could not be cleaned. I wanna call them nasty but I won't go there. I didn't walk in the door with this. But that's what I left with. #calltheexterminator!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren
