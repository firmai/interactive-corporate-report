31,Lennae P.,"Southaven, Memphis, TN",0,13,,1.0,2014-10-12,"Poor service & poorly prepared food. First we had to wait quite a while for a server to take our order. When we got our food, it didn't get any better.  The guacamole was bland and the vegetables & pork carnitas for fajitas were over-cooked and under-seasoned. The original ribs seemed boiled rather than ""slow-smoked"" as advertised, and the BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup.  Having eaten these items at other Chili's locations, and having been satisfied then, we knew this food wasn't consistent with the Chili's brand standard. We spoke with a manager and expressed our disappointment. He became defensive and told us that that the menu described the food incorrectly, and they were consistent with other Chili's.

17,Kendra W.,"Tupelo, MS",0,42,4.0,2.0,2015-03-26,"I normally love Chilis! Especially the Southwestern egg roll, but this location leaves so much to desired. Which is a shame, because I had come here a few months earlier and had a decent experience. My husband and I went at the end of the lunch rush and it took a little bit of time to be seated, at least 6-7 minutes. When we were seated, we not only didn't see our server for almost 10 minutes, no one came to give us drinks. Get this, our server was too busy rambling to the table behind us and taking care of them. The woman training our waitress had to come serve us and she didn't come until she saw my husband get up to go look for someone. With that aside, we placed our drink and appetizer orders. We ordered the fried pickles, which were not bad but the drinks were a little flat, but nothing dismal. Once again, we waited a good minute before being to order our meals, I got a cheeseburger and my husband ordered some sort of cheese quesadilla with rice and black beans. My burger was on the dry and season less side (nothing ketchup couldn't fix I suppose) and it was missing a few dressings but oh well. My husband's quesadilla and black beans were good, but the rice wasn't completely cooked!  Our waitress only refilled our drinks once - remember she was too busy chatting away. We were ready to pay and get out of there and once again it took so long to get the check, we just opted to pay at the table kiosk instead of the usual way and left. Needless to say, she didn't get much of a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2,1.224,1.224,1.224,1.224,1.2240000000000002

33,K L.,"Kyle, TX",0,3,,1.0,2015-12-31,".On December 26th around 10-11 pm my wife and I decided to walk from our hotel room and have a late evening appetizer and drink. We went into the bar area and stood for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Finally I asked a waiter to clean off a table so we could be seated (there was only one available). His response was far from customer friendly. He said they were working to clean the tables and would get to it as they can. He stood and chatted with some locals, took away a few glasses for some customers and walked past me 3 times.) He finally wiped the table down and told me ""it's clean"". The seats had crumbs all over them and the floor was filthy. When I said what about the seats he seemed frustrated I didn't just sit in the crumbs and bent over to wipe them down. I could only imagine if I'd asked him to clean the floor I the booth. At that time I told him don't worry about it and left. I was disgusted at the poor customer service and his nasty attitude. I was not rude to him, he just didn't want to be bothered. His loss, I typically tip around 30%. I'm not from that area and really expected some good old southern hospitality.

If they don't care any more than to have their restaurants run this way, then they are in trouble. The lady who served us was nice enough, but slow and this was during a lull in restaurant business. When I asked her for a couple more minutes to look, that couple of minutes took about 7, while she talked to a table of young ladies behind us about who they know, high school friends, etc...the food took quite some time to get there and only half of mine showed up. I got my grilled chicken sandwich, but the skillet mashed potatoes arrived after I got done eating it. I had one glass of water and wasn't asked if I wanted a refill.

13,Bill R.,"Tupelo, MS",72,183,14.0,1.0,2016-02-03,"I don't usually review chain restaurants because I don't think anyone needs guidance on what the food tastes like.  I happen to rather enjoy Chili's food.   They make a really nice house salad, I love the chips and salsa.  Everything fried is pretty good and their takes on TexMex are interesting sometimes.  The dry rub ribs are not outstanding, but serviceable. They still have no idea how to steam veggies or make rice.  Paying your check through the kiosk instead of waiting on staff is the best thing ever. So it should be apparent that I'm more or less a fan. This particular location ruins all of that with the worst service you'll find.  Clueless college kid staff that are more concerned with showing you their tattoos or piercings or flexing for the next table than getting the order right.  Being herded into the bar because the dining area is underserviced.  Seating a quiet couple next to a table full of rowdy infants on a mommy margarita lunch when the place is half empty.  Southwestern salads with ranch dressing instead of Southwestern.  Asking me what kind of dressing I want on a Caesar. Not knowing what comes with the meal ordered.  Avacado salad with no avacado.  I once ordered a strawberry lemonade and they brought me lemonade with the strawberry shot at the bottom and told me to stir it up myself, the bar was busy.  I looked over and the bar WAS busy flirting with college age girls sitting at the bar.  Once ordered dry rub ribs and was brought wet ribs.  Pointed this out and she took the plate back.  10 mins later, I got the same plate back with the sauce wiped off and dry rub dashed heavily all over it.  Idiots didn't even hide it - the sauce was still peeking through in places.  When you are lucky enough to get things right, the food tends to be good.  I'm convinced that almost all the problems here come from the wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2,,,,,
27,Holly T.,"Pensacola, FL",0,3,,1.0,2016-06-05,"This has to be the nastiest Chili's I have ever been in! I wouldn't want my dog to even eat in here! It is so unbelievably dirty! We were traveling and stopped bc it looked new and clean from the outside. When we walked in, I told the hostess there were two in our party, she pointed to the bar area and said ""you just want to grab a booth over there?"" So we did! I would like to state, the place was empty, there may have been 10 guests total in the whole place. We sat down and the table was covered with food! We had to ask for the table to be cleaned, and that just made our waitress mad, she did not want to clean the table. I went to the restroom and it was even dirtier than the restaurant! Urine all over the toilets and floor, toilet paper every where, it was nasty! Besides being dirty, we witnessed two older women come in and be seated and never got waited on, they eventually got up and left. Before leaving one of the ladies stood at the front forever waiting to tell someone that they were leaving bc no one waited on them. Don't know where the hostess was, the lady ended up talking to a server that just happened to walk by! We should have known this place was a bust when we pulled up and all the servers were outside smoking! Whoever owns this place should do a loyalty check on their employees! I would be ashamed!

I just had one of the worst experiences ever at a resturant, and it was at the Tupelo Chile's. Compared to the pizza place at Barnes Crossing, they are doing pretty good, but compared to the higher level of service expected of casual dining establishments, they are horrible. We arrived at 11:45 AM on a Sunday, and the restaurant was 25% full, or 75% empty, depending on your perspective. To sum it up, it was 10 minutes before the waitress came to the table, another 30 minutes before the appetizer arrived, and another 30 minutes before the entrees arrived. If you didn't catch that, it was 1 hour and 10 minutes until we received our food. We got really tired of waiting. I mean, really tired. By the time our food arrived, we were so full of soda that we weren't hungry. About 10 minutes before the food came, I was so tired of waiting that I almost told the waitress to cancel the order and bring the check. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2,,,,,

(See pics) This would not have been so terrible if I had not already waited close to an hour to receive my meal. Yes they eventually made it right, but it was too much trouble and not worth the money and effort.

Fuji, Longhorn and anywhere else on N Gloster before you come here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tupelo-2,1.36,1.36,1.36,,1.36
