Phil C.,"Lake Oswego, OR",1,27,1,3.0,10/5/2017,"Good atmosphere, good food. It is by far the slowest service Red Robin consistently. I live in Wilsonville and dread it when my kids want to eat here. Tonight 15 minutes for a server just to come to the table to take a drink order. Ordered 15 minutes ago and still waiting. Maybe by the time this post we may actually see our server again. Doubtful....argh! At least offer some fries while we wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Nina E.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,5,,2.0,12/11/2017,"My boyfriend and I just got out of this restaurant and experienced a really nice waitress up until she thought she wasn't getting a tip. We paid in cash with the bill being $26.16 and gave her $27. She came back to the table and put the change on the table and we said thanks and she said ""yep"" and walked away with the meanest look on her face and didn't look at either of us. She didn't even tell us have a good day or thanks for coming in.  I like to wait till we're just about to leave to place a tip on the table because it's moments like these that make me not want to tip. I ended up giving her a 18% and I was going to give 20% until she was rude because she thought we weren't tipping her.  I am a waitress and my boyfriend is a waiter so we could completely tell that this is why she was being rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
carnage k.,"Union, OR",19,1,,2.0,10/21/2017,"Ordered avocado salad. It was good. My gf ordered the same thing only to find a very long hair buried in the salad. Waitress was sympathetic and made it right. The floor was slippery throughout the restaurant. Reminded me of the greasy floor in the kitchen when I worked at McDonald's in the 80's. Even when sitting, putting the weight of my foot on the floor caused it to slide forward, despite wearing non slip shoes. I used tablet at the table to pay the bill.

And I mean it, a Wilsonville has the worst customer service second to one other city...but that's another time/story/review. Red Robin, the food is roughly the same as other Red Robin's.

Tanya C.,"Wilsonville, OR",129,307,142,4.0,11/25/2016,"Enjoyed our night before Thanksgiving dinner here and had the arctic cod fish sandwich with an EGG on it, yes, I said EGG! It is delicious. The french fries always seem so minuscule on the plate when you get your order, but they are bottomless and the burgers are so big and juicy, it makes sense.  The husband tried a new pepper burger and my brother in law had the Whiskey beef burger. He ordered it without mayo and it came with mayo. He scraped it off and sad the burger was cooked perfectly. Our server, Nick, was fantastic and he ended up turning me on to a new beer when I asked if they had any good red ales. It was MacNJacks African ALe. DELICIOUS!!! I am now on the hunt for this Redmond, Or made beer.  We were seated quickly when we walked in because we were all over 21 and had no children, so we were seated quickly within the 21 and older section. Can I just say, I love this section and concept. Not all of us have or want children and it is nice to be able to go somewhere, have a few beers, let your hair down and not have to worry about offending some parent with their kids sitting at the bar because you dropped an ""F"" bomb. Thanks Red Robin. See you again soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Michaela T.,"Portland, OR",183,78,37,4.0,12/26/2016,"I love Red Robin. I'd give any Red Robin 5 stars honestly. Always happy to go! This is the only chain restaurant I'm happy to go to because I know exactly what to expect and there's a level of comfort in that. My only gripe is the employees appearance here is not as regulated as some of the other restaurants around. I saw torn up red vans from a male employee.. and the waitress had very long necklaces on that was close to touching our food. Other than that, this ones not my favorite but I'll still give it 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Karin H.,"Salem, OR",112,215,62,3.0,1/6/2017,"Stopped in on a Friday night for dinner as we were passing through town on the interstate.  I wasn't really feeling all that great, but needed to eat something  (as did everyone else in the car ) before we headed on up the freeway.  The server messed up and put lemon in my sods instead of the requested lime, but was very quick to rectify the situation  (yes, lemon in my drink is a situation ).  I ordered the chicken strips and fries, husband had a chicken sandwich burger thing and stepson had a whisky river bbq burger.  I don't think anyone had any complaints about their orders, but it wasn't anything oooh aaah spectacular, I mean it was chicken strips after all. I really like the self pay at your table that RR has adopted.  Makes it so much easier when you are trying to keep a schedule if you don't have to wait for the server to bring you the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Erick B.,"Beaverton, OR",37,152,59,4.0,4/17/2017,"Yet another variation of the pub mac and cheese, but it was still pretty good (work on your consistency Red Robin please). We had the nachos as an appetizer and let's just say that they didn't last very long (grubbin!), and the cherry limeade hit the spot as well.  Lizzie was our server and she did a great job, with a friendly attitude. Our drinks didn't make it to empty before we had a replacement on the table.

Cindy B.,"McMinnville, OR",21,5,,2.0,1/20/2017,"Meh, is the best way to describe it.  We ordered drinks and a couple appetizers, then ordered our food. I ordered the DGB burger which looked delicious.  We received our food just a few short minutes later, then noticed a long and thick strand of hair in my burger. The waiter came back asked if we needed anything as I had been looking over at him trying to get his attention, I showed him the hair that was still attached to the veggies. He apologized and took it right away.  He came back a couple minutes later with more fries and said the manager would be remaking it. Instead of asking if I'd prefer something else or at least take something off our bill.  Got my burger, was expecting more and that goes for all the food. Paying over $60 for a meal that was meh is a bit depressing. My daughters meal looked like it was literally just thrown on the plate.  I probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville

Ryan P.,"Wilsonville, OR",2,85,76,1.0,9/3/2016,I hate coming to this RR. It has the worst service. Wasn't my choice to come here. Just took 15 min for pretzel bites. 10 min for a ice tea.

Nhi L.,"Wilsonville, OR",62,4,,3.0,8/11/2016,"I haven't been here for a few years, so when my best friend expressed he wanted to go there for our next lunch date, I said okay.  I walk in and the hostess is accommodating and she's friendly and leads me to my table. I sit and I wait for maybe 2-3 minutes before my waitress comes and asks if I'm waiting for someone. I say yes, and instead of asking me if I would like a drink meanwhile, she starts walking away. I tell her I would like to order a root beer meanwhile I'm waiting for my friend and she says okay and walks off. Comes back 5 minutes later with the drink and walks off again.  My friend arrives 15 minutes later and a different waitress comes up and asks if we're ready to order as we were about to send off our order using the machine. We ask her to give us a few minutes to decide and so she leaves. 20 minutes later, a different waitress comes by and asks if we're ready, so say yes and we give her our order. I order my bacon cheeseburger with no tomatoes and with cheddar cheese, and instead of the regular bottomless fries, if I can get the herb fries instead. She says yes and my friend orders his with an extra serving of fries. She takes our order and leaves. 10 minutes more pass and our onion rings come out. We're sitting and chatting and playing on the machine while we wait, and another different waitress ( this is 4 now) comes and delivers our food. The burgers were correct but they gave me regular fries. They neglected to give my friend his extra serving of fries. The fries they DO give us however, are half assed barely filled containers. We shrug it off because it's bottomless anyways. So we didn't worry.  We're chit chatting, eating and finishing up drinks, and one waitress comes by to collect my friend's empty glasses, and leaves mine. She clearly saw it because it was RIGHT next to my friends. She asks if he found everything okay, totally ignoring me. At this point, I'm either thinking she's being rude to me for no reason, or it's probably because she doesn't think being friendly to me is worth anything. I resolve to give her a minimum tip.  We continue talking and playing games, and not once has any of those waitresses asked if we'd like a refill on our fries. Not even once. They don't come back after collecting the cups, so we decide to order our dessert using the machine. They deliver it, collects our plates and say nothing. We don't see them afterwards. Drinks are empty, no offers on refills for our bottomless fries, and they forgotten about us.  Overall, their customer service needs to be improved. Food was okay. Attitudes need adjusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Brian C.,"Wilsonville, OR",0,7,,3.0,3/17/2017,"I've had mixed success here. A lot depends on the waiters/waitresses I guess. I go here about once a month or so, and most of the time staff is courteous and helpful and the food is good. The last two times we went there it seemed, we had some attitude from the waiters. This can make or break a dining experience in my opinion. My wife has an allergic reaction to gluten, for her its not a preference as much as a need. We ordered gluten free for her, and they made a regular hamburger with regular fries. We asked him to correct her order, and he insisted it should be fine to keep the innards and just throw it on a new Gluten free bun. It was still contaminated, and looked really messy when he finished. He was kind of grumpy about it so we just ate anyway. Furthermore, the fries were not gluten free, and he didn't want to fix that either (while all fries are potato, gluten free fries are made in a separate part of the kitchen to avoid contamination). The next time we went, we came for desert, and ordered a giant mud pie to split. The waiter gave us grief for not ordering a full meal. He tried to pass it off as a joke when we looked a bit upset, but mentioned it later when it came time to pay (sarcastically saying, ""who's going to splurge for the bill?""). I've never felt so humiliated in a restaurant! We weren't trying to be cheap, we just didn't need more food.  I don't want to give it 2 stars based on a couple of grumpy waiter's, but I'm hoping the next time we go will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Frank B.,"Canby, OR",0,10,,1.0,7/30/2017,"My wife and I stopped by around 3:30 on a Friday afternoon. We assumed based on the time of day we would be able to get in and out fairly quick. As we walked thru the front door, we were immediately taken to a table where we sat un acknowledged for at least 20 minutes. A waiter walked past us twice, but didn't appear to have any interest in taking care of us. We decided we had wasted enough time and headed for the door. As we walked past the host, I told him he should try to seat customers at a table that actually has an assigned server. His reply was ""okay"".

Jen M.,"Portland, OR",0,10,,2.0,5/24/2017,We decided to give this location another chance because the first visit was less than stellar. Staff is friendly enough. The Marco Pollo was very good.

Jeffrey R.,"Molalla, OR",15,89,3,3.0,1/11/2015,"After many satisfying visits to this Red Robin location, I had an experience that seems to closely match other recent visits by other yelpers. I still hold high regard for the chain in general, but today's execution really left a lot to be desired. If this had been my only visit, I would have put it at two stars -- but I'm not ready to write them off yet. My wife, son, and daughter accompanied me on this visit, and we requested one children's menu at the hostess station. After getting situated, my daughter informed me she had a menu, but no crayons or paper place-mat (aka entertainment) -- no big deal, but it took a little while to make it to the table. Drink and main dish ordering was uneventful. And then we waited... and waited... and waited. Our server finally stopped by, saw we had no food yet, and said he would go check on it... When our food finally arrived, everyone's dishes were fine except for mine -- I had ordered a Red's Big Tavern, Fiery Ghost Style, with a side salad; and they brought out what looked like a kid's cheeseburger. The waiter left the salad and took the burger back -- at which point I realized that our table had no silverware, which meant I had no way to eat the salad. The waiter came back and said they were firing a new burger for me, and that he would bring silverware -- he claimed the burger just had the wrong cheese on it, but I know it was a complete screw up somewhere along the line. Finally my burger came out, and our server disappeared. My son downed all of his fries and wanted more, but the server was nowhere to be found. I drained my iced tea, thanks to some especially spicy jalapenos; but no waiter around to refill. My wife's water ran dry. The long wait made for an even longer experience because we then had to wait for everything to be refilled. The food was good, overall; but all of the other miscues really detracted from the experience. Any one mistake as a stand-alone would not be a big deal, but all of them together in one visit made for a very amateurish execution. We will be back, but I really hope they figure out how to step up their game between now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Macie F.,"Wilsonville, OR",10,6,,2.0,11/11/2016,The last few visits to this Red Robin has been disappointing. Gourmet burgers HA. Tastes like a normal burger with some extra stuff thrown on it. The staff are fake in their wishing you a good day and so slow. Both recent visits we had to have another waitress track down our waitress and then it takes them just as long get your change. We have watched our waitress sit down to eat and chat when she was supposed to be waiting on people and then tell us she forgot what she was doing.

Topher N.,"Wilsonville, OR",7,28,2,1.0,1/15/2016,"Hit or miss here.  Was super pleased with a recent visit.  The food was amazing with a BBQ wrap & a bruschetta turkey burger me and my wife split.  Came back a week or two later to  get the same thing and the turkey burger was horrible/uneatable.  I took a bite, my wife took a bite and we set it down. Told the waiter about it and he asked if we could see anything different and I said ""no"".  Apparently since I didn't know exactly what was wrong with the burger we were not deserving of an alternative to make up for it.  So, since I wasn't full I just ate some more frys and still left feeling hungry and unsatisfied... I understand in the service industry sometimes people try to get away with things or get freebies.  Problem for us was, pretty much the whole turkey burger was uneaten (minus 2 bites). So he (the waiter) could clearly see we weren't going to eat the burger, so it wasn't like we were trying to get some extra food or a handout.   So he left us paying for an $11 burger that we didn't even eat.  There was no offer of something else or even a do-over.  He didn't bother to try an get it taken off our bill, just left us to pay for an uneaten burger and sent us on our way.  I brought it up to him hoping he might try to help us out in some form or another, but he basically shrugged it off and moved on.   Truly some of the worst service I've ever received.  Me and my wife both decided we were never going back.  It's not a cheap place and I'm not a fan of paying exuberant prices if I'm left to pay the tab when given garbage food.  And it wasn't so much the food as much as the lack of help when it was clear the food was not to our liking.  Just very poor service if anything goes wrong, so just a heads up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,8/12/2011,"After dropping our dogs off at Critter Cabana, the 3 of us came here for lunch while the rest of the family opted for a fast food joint in Canby. We were eating late, so Kevin and I decided to share a burger while the daughter had a chicken sandwich. We all appreciated that we could substitute other things like melon or kettle chips for the bottomless fries.  Red Robin does not make great burgers. They are pre-formed and are not really able to be cooked to anything less than medium. They do make some mean onion rings and service was efficient with our beverages being refilled regularly.  We would come back to this location and the husband is definitely intrigued by the idea of a bottomless root beer float so who knows if it will be during this vacation or not. I would veto going to a RR back home (due to better restaurants around). but it was a sufficient late lunch in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=40

The food is served quickly and it's what I ordered.  I am not thrilled about paying $10 for a hamburger and fries - even as good as they are here.  It makes me wonder if 4 stars is appropriate - I wish I could rate it 3 1/2 stars but I think I may have a bit of an old-school idea when it comes to 'fair pricing' so I went with 4.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=40
Jacob H.,"Montesano, WA",2,6,2,2.0,10/4/2015,"Stopped here for a bite to eat on the way home after a road trip only because I had a $25 gift card. The poor service started quickly and was constant throughout. Wanted to sit in the lounge section so I can keep my eye on my vehicle so the lady at the front said only for 21 and over. I don't look 15 and neither does my lady but we weren't planning on getting drinks so no big deal we went and sat. Immediately were interrogated for our ID's. My lady left hers in the vehicle, so she had to go out and grabs hers and I show the bartender mine. He walks away. Before my lady returned he came order to get my drink order. I said I'd wait for her to return first. Then we ordered onion ring appetizers which were super greasy and there were no napkins at the table. I walked to the bus station and grabbed some and no one made an effort to apologize or take notice. Then we ordered the food. It arrived quickly but we had no silver ware or napkins and had to ask for them. I ordered my burger without tomatoes and a side of bbq sauce. I didn't receive my side and the burger had tomatoes on it. Okay food, but don't come here expecting good service.

Yes it's Friday night and we have 3 kids and 3 adults but there was dirty tables just sitting there with no effort to clean off. Our table had bits of lettuce and sauce left over from previous diners. The food came out and the waitress told us they ran out of sauce for our DGB burgers but I told them I was fine without it.

This is also a typical stop to celebrate birthdays.  The kids love the attention and special ice cream sundae.  Although I should note that Son #1 usually cleans his plate pretty quickly and needs more food.  Guess he's at that scary age where I might need to start ordering off the adult menu.  Although we just discovered that they will give you an extra portion of the kids meal entree if they clean their plate.  Yeah! This location has about six arcade games and at least one of them is guaranteed to eat your quarters.  But it is nice having some distractions while we are waiting for our food to arrive.  There is also an outdoor patio which is nice on hot summer nights.

When we asked for the manager to discuss the unacceptable performance from the kitchen, the manager was righteous, moderately indignant, and actually had the audacity to tell us we were mistaken about how long we had been waiting. Apparently, customer service training excludes management in the Red Robin Corporation.  Order taken at 7:30pm, hamburgers delivered at 9:00pm. 2 of the orders wrong. Aside from the inaccuracy, where I come from, that's 90 minutes. There was no apology, only a smug ""Well, the kitchen was backed up.""  There were only a few tables in the restaurant occupied! As we were leaving, they offered us a free slice of mud pie. We didn't accept because by then, all we wanted was to fly out of Red Robin. 2 burgers got sent back to the kitchen because they weren't remotely the correct order, and it was 15 minutes to get the right burger. In my humble opinion, they should have been free. All the respect in the world to mud pie we didn't want.  Listen, I can accept mistakes or the fact that Ernesto walked out on his job in the kitchen.

Mollie H.,"Wilsonville, OR",91,38,9,2.0,11/9/2012,"Food took 40 minutes, waiter checked on our table once, brought the wrong order. With 2 kids and a family... Ridiculous. Normally 4 stars but tonight was horrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Debra B.,"Kirkland, WA",75,186,389,4.0,2/10/2011,"It's a national chain, so you know what to expect when you come here. The menu has a lot of variety and the our order was very good. We like the garlic-parmesan fries (no longer on the menu) but available for a small upcharge upon request. My hubby had a great burger, a generous patty, thick cheese and smoky bacon on nicely cooked on a tasty bun with fresh toppings. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, cheese & bacon. It was good, but I think they do burgers better than chicken, which didn't have the ""grill"" taste I would have preferred. Prices are on the high end, but service is fast & friendly and they are consistent.  I prefer the local dives for burgers, but Red Robin is a nice alternative!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Aleasha G.,"Aurora, OR",62,142,103,4.0,5/21/2010,"Okay...yes...this is a review of a chain.  But I wanted to give a special mentioning for this one.  I've been here on multiple occasions and have YET to have had even one bad experience.   Also a friend & I got into the habit of getting their YUMMY Cobb Salad for lunch...so when we ordered it to go & mentioned we were spliltting it, they kindly divided it into two separate to go containers (which portion-wise equated to more than one normal cobb salad order). Very nice!  I really appreciated the extra effort!!! And who doesn't love the bottomless fries!!!  I mean really?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Scott G.,"Kapaa, HI",39,18,1,3.0,5/19/2011,"The star rating reflects the fact that this restaurant is good at what they're aiming for.  Just like you wouldn't wear a tuxedo to a rock concert (would you?), don't come here for fast food or fine dining. The service here was pretty darn good.  Before I could think refill, it was already there.  Before I could wonder about what else I might want to add to the order, our waiter had already offered.  They use food runners here, which I hate.  It always turns into an auction at the table.  Overall, the service boosted the effort put forth by the kitchen. The food was what's expected at a Red Robin.  Yum!...for the most part.  The bottomless steak fries were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, providing a delicious combination perfect for fries.  We also had the chips and salsa appetizer, which comes with a tasty guacamole.  The salsa isn't anything special, but the guacamole makes them worth ordering again.  I had a burger, ordered medium, but cooked well, which made the burger dry.  The crispy jalapenos were no longer crispy, and obviously had not just come out of the fryer.  The product sent out by the kitchen was sub-par and diminished my previous evaluation of this chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Cedric N.,"Beaverton, OR",301,164,1386,5.0,11/24/2013,Katie is always a great bartender! I enjoy sitting at the bar.

Kim S.,"West Linn, OR",260,36,1,3.0,4/1/2012,"Food was fine as expected, but the staff were so noisy. Seriously are they deaf or just obnoxious? And even if you are a family restaurant you could still have a policy of first seating folks with children in a particular area. I'm fine with kids but I don't want to always be around them when dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Steve S.,"Stayton, OR",11,95,25,4.0,11/13/2012,The service was awesome and the food was wonderful as usual.  The stake fries are the best!!  They could update the inside by adding new flat screen monitors and more of them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Richard A.,"Bend, OR",0,86,,2.0,9/28/2014,Not a great location for service and cleanliness. We would drive to the Sherwood location and wait in line over going to the Wilsonville one that was a mile from our house.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Lily L.,"Salem, OR",41,180,12,3.0,6/25/2012,"After walking in, me and my boyfriend were greeted by two hostess. They seem college aged and not very friendly. They had no smiles on your face. After putting the menu on the table, the words from the hostess was, your server will be right with you. Right now red robin is serving the red tavern burger for 6.99. For that price, it comes with unlimited steak fries. The burger itself is a double patty burger with tomato, lettuce, cheese and onion. For $1, you can upgrade it to the different types of burger that is listed, such as a jalepeno burger, buffalo burger or even a ghost pepper burger!!!   Our server was very polite and nice. However she had a hearing aide, so the way she spoke was kind of strange. Seeing someone with a 'disability' hired at red robin, I think that was nice. The food came in  a timely manner. She did check up on us, which was nice. -Just a thought- -The bar area is really small here, I wouldnt think this would be an ideal happy hour -place. - This location is kind of new, but some of the flat screens were kind of fuzzy. - This place has an arcade corner, that needs to be bigger. That corner looks very cramp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
Danielle K.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",276,583,122,4.0,12/16/2008,"THE DATE 16 December 2008, i.e., Birthday No. 24 THE TIME Around noon. Maybe noon-fifteen THE SCENE Normally for birthdays in the office, our Supplies Manager and Customer Service Guru J makes sure that everyone (i.e., the other four employees) is signed up to bring some sort of delectable treat for a potluck lunch, because in these economically stressed times, we're not going to buy lunch for the office that often. This morning, J comes in sans crock pot full of enchilada soupy goodness, saying her hubby forgot to stick it in the fridge before going to sleep, and he wouldn't let her take it to work, fearful that we'd all get food poisoning. Then coworker N comes in, sans raspberry-filled chocolate cupcake deliciousness, citing weather for preventing him from picking them up from his ma's. Then boss B comes in, wielding a box...of magical birthday donuts. We obviously take said donuts and love them until there were no more, but this was also at 8 a.m., and by the time lunch rolled around, we all found ourselves hungry and without food. Dilemma! J, an adamant supporter of Sonic, suggested we go there. This was just as adamantly shot down by a chorus of staff who did not want to sit in B's car without heat in the ice, eating tots. Thai? N would have none of it. Mexi? Had that yesterday. As we were about to settle for shivering with our greasy goodness, B shouts out ""RED ROBIN."" And it doesn't sound half bad, but in the back of my head, I'm thinking, ""Shiiiit, this is one of those places that will sing to you...YEEP!"" I make them promise no funny business, and they don't say a word. THE WEATHER Second day of ARCTIC BLAST 2008...ice and snow and salted ground. ACT II We're all seated at a booth (why couldn't we get that huge round-table booth??), and are very quickly asked if we were ready to order. Uhhh...no...but thanks! We all ordered. We all enjoyed a basket of burgers and fries that was WAY too big for lunch. But we pretty much all ate it all. The guacamole bacon burger was pretty good, although it could have used a little spice. But basically anything involving bacon and/or avocados has my endorsement. B pulled out all the guns with the Burning Love burger...they packed as much heat as humanly possible on this thing--a jalapeno-infused kaiser bun, cayenne-seasoned beef patty, chipotle mayo, pepper jack cheese, salsa, and fried jalapenos--and he commented that it could have been hotter. I'm not sure if I believe him. Because, you know, it might be a little awkward if I asked him for a bite. CLIMAX We get our check, and B graciously takes it like a man (or like our boss). Our server also leaves a survey so he could give them feedback on the burger (apparently they're the only location in Oregon serving the Burning Love, for some reason). He starts filling it out. Then I see him flip over the survey and write something on it, making sure his hand is covering the words. Then he slips it into the bill-fold thinger, and the waitress takes it. B is pretty bad at keeping secrets, at least when he's trying to play a prank on someone. And I glance at him because I know something's up, and he's got a totally goofy smirk on his face. Oh, crap, I tell myself. When's the singing gonna come? Then, I hear it: Who's the birthday girl?? One of the servers ask. Of course it was me. What's your name, hun? Danielle. Okay, now take this spoon, and hold it up high, she continues as she plops down a hot fudge sundae in front of me. Then they do their clappy sing-sing thing and go away... DENOUEMENT ...but not before I ask for three more spoons. B, very satisfied with himself, exclaims that he HAD to bring me here because he HAD to get a rise out of me. Hahahahaha! And we all enjoyed some ice cream before going home to work. THE MORAL Red Robin isn't a bad place. It actually has pretty decent food. And the wait staff was sweet as sugar (especially the lady who called me princess and asked where I got my hat). So yeah, I dig it...even if 10 year olds--and obnoxious bosses--get the most entertainment value. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilsonville?start=60
