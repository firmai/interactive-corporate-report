Steve P.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",225,400,1029,4.0,12/23/2010,"Swung in here on our way through Baltimore, with the weather being as cold as it was, of course the outdoor seating wasn't available. When it is open, you get a nice view of the harbor and you can people watch quite nicely. I ordered the bbq chicken pizza and had them add pineapple. When it first came out, it was missing the onions. The server had no problem with whisking it away and having them make another one which took about 5 minutes or so, not a bad rush ticket. They weren't too busy while we were there, just a few tables having lunch since it was the middle of the week.  Clean location, attentive servers and the food was good, after it was corrected that is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-baltimore
