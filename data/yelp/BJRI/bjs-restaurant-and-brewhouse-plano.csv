Sumeet K.,"Plano, TX",44,71,18,5.0,5/8/2017,Amazing place when it comes to good food (with tons of healthy options) and cheap beer. Their own beers are really good as well. Just tell the server the name of the branded beer that you love and they will tell you their matching or similar beers (typical of brewery) !! I love their enlightened menu options as well. Great service on this location. A minor issue happened where our tables were cleared after we went to the restrooms. We had asked to have the leftovers to-go'ed. But tables got cleared by mistake. Manager was courteous enough to get us the complete new order of our food made and packed to-go (in 5-10 mins) along with an apology. Very polite management and top customer service. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Hannah M.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",0,15,17,3.0,10/2/2017,"Went to BJs for a date late dinner date. I was craving dessert so I ordered a chocolate chip pazookie. It was delicious, soft warm cookie and two scoops of vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend orders baked zitti. His pasta wasn't fully cooked and it was pretty bland. It came with a garlic knot and the knot was hard as a rock, so we didn't bother eating it, wasn't very appetizing. We had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, those were cooked to perfection. Very yummy, will order every time I go there!! Service was exceptional, as usual. The energy there is always great too, it's a great place to catch games and drink some beers. I'm giving them 3 stars because of the baked ziti, it definitely fell short of expectations. Will definitely go back, but I won't order the baked ziti again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Aubrey E.,"Celina, TX",182,42,34,1.0,8/24/2017,"I usually always enjoy my experiences no matter how it turns out but BJs Brewhouse did NOT make a very good 1st impression.  The food wasn't to our liking and I tried my girlfriends and my other buddy's sirloin (he was our 3rd wheel :) ) Please have the owner contact me. We had to check on our alcoholic drinks due to wait time; luckily I ordered water and lime. I never got the lime. The alcoholic drinks got there right before the food arrived (15-25min wait).  Service was terrible despite it not being ""too busy"" but she still earned 35% tip. We didn't even take the food home; sirloin went to our handsome huskies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Dallas G.,"Dallas, TX",210,21,262,1.0,4/30/2017,"One star for being able to fulfill our 1 hour call ahead reservation. We arrived at 5:50pm and were seated by 6:05pm. I chose this establishment for my sister's birthday to accommodate some picky eaters in our party.  We ordered a couple of appetizers, classic fried mozzarella sticks & spinach artichoke dip. Basic as it gets.  What really bothered me are the plates. They were so filthy, greasy and wet. I had to find another server to switch them out. Only to get another set that were just as disgusting. That really pissed me off. I couldn't help to think how unsanitary the kitchen is, how they prep, handle food and drinks.  They also had no Chimay and Heineken in stock. I ordered the deep dish pizza. Pretty much raw vegetables thrown on top.. the line cook may have hoped it'll finish cooking from the residual heat? The meat, pepperoni, sausage couldn't taste anymore fake than it was. I also ordered a side caesar salad, dressing on the side. It was on the side alright, but recall the dirty plates? My ramekin was most likely was pulled from the dish pit (see pic), crusted with old food and oil, nestled on my salad. Perhaps the dishwasher might not have been working properly tonight?  We brought our own birthday cake and was given to our server before the meal. When it came time, I expected the server to at least get it out of the box and place the candles on it. Nope. We had to open it up and prepare everything in front of my sister. Nice cake surprise presentation huh?  The managers never stopped by to do quality or experience checks. One of them dropped glassware next to our table. Didn't apologize or made sure the other guests were okay. To top it off, he picked up the shards with his bare hands.  Careless in all ways possible. What a pathetic experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Josh H.,"The Colony, TX",223,47,21,4.0,4/14/2017,"I have been to BJ's only a few times in my life, but have always had a great experience each time I've been.  This location in particular is close to my work and a great place to come for a quick bite and break from the mundane! The menu has a great range of various items for the health conscious to the eh... fried conscious *shamelessly raises hand*.  I will say, if you are one that gets a bit overwhelmed with a small novella menu of options, stay focused...they have a lot of options :)   The food here is always great and reasonably priced.  This trip I had the California Club Sandwich, which was a grilled chicken breast with cheese, avocado on toasted bread.  It was very good. My work colleagues said that the Ahi Tuna salad was great as well as the BBQ sandwich.  Our server was kind and efficient.  The desserts are definitely worth a look...that pizzokie especially.  (a cookie pizza....um YES!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Ray F.,"Dallas, TX",80,414,160,2.0,4/2/2017,"I was with a party of 9 on a Friday evening.  I was with a date and we were there 30 minutes early.  We made our table request for a table and were told 45-50 minutes.   So we went on to the bar to wait. The bar staff were friendly, but no Bushmills.  I settled on something else and waited.  At the 40 minute mark, we were told they were ready for us.  It was a booth and that wouldn't work with our group.  So we waited another 10 minutes and a table was ready.   As we were sitting down, the staff dropped a drink which splattered on my open toes and my cast.  As a couple of wait-staff began cleaning up the liquid, another dropped his tray with a loud bang.  Three times during the meal, one of the waiters knocked into my chair. Of all of those incidents; one apology on a chair bump.   The food was delivered with the expected confusion for a large party's order.  All was quickly sorted out. A couple noted the pizzas were not really well cooked. The rest loved their meals. We ordered desserts and for some reason, one was brought to go (mine).  (I guess they really wanted me to leave?) The billing was also a problem and took a couple of tries.   Other than that, the server was attentive. Another note, the background music was quite loud which required all to have to talk loud.  My ears were actually ring when we left!     Perhaps it was the party size?  The crowded Friday?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano

My Mother had the California Chicken Club, and I had the Smoked Salmon With Cherry Sauce. All three of us loved our meal! The Smoked Salmon With The Cherry Sauce was so good! I have eaten at many white table cloth fancy restaurants and this dish blow every dish away that I have had at every fancy restaurant.  Totally Delicious!   My Sister and Mother both had margaritas and I had a mixed strawberry drink that tasted like strawberry cheesecake!  That drink was so good.  Also, I guess due to the size, you not only have your waiter, but there is another person floating around making sure every table was alright.   I think that is an awesome business model for any large and very busy restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Harvey S.,"Frisco, TX",163,217,123,2.0,8/1/2016,Over the years I've been here many times.  Lately the service has become spotty at best.   Today at lunch we had to wait 15 minutes after being seated before we were able to get a servers attention.  The manager came by and gave the perfunctory sorry and promised to speed up our food.   It didn't help.  It still took a long time and my companions chili was just above room temperature.    We will have to find another place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Joe M.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/14/2017,This restaurant in plano always seems to not meet my expectations. I go to the one in addison quite a bit and it is excellent. I used my app ( member) to reserve a table early. I show up and they say no reservation. I check my app and I have a bill on my app. They gave my seat to someone else who is no using my account number. They manager closes the tab out. Never offers an apology. So calmly I sit at the bar. I go to the desk after 15 minutes and they say we have been texting and calling u for a table. I check my phone ( only number they have) no texts or calls. They top it off with lying after they gave away our reservation with no apologies. Guess I have had enough. Time to move on. The waiters seem r To turn over a lot and the service has gone down hill.

Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,953,1686,4.0,9/23/2016,"My team did a fundraiser here one night. They call them ""spirit nights."" The restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected. They have a bar area and a general dining area. Their menu is a bit overwhelming because there are SO many options. I couldn't figure out what I wanted because everything sounded amazing. They have gluten free options for those with a food allergy. I chose to get the ahi tuna salad. It was great! Light but filling! They actually give you a good amount of tuna.  The food is decently priced and the portions are a good size. I would definitely recommend stopping in here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Yong Y.,"Richardson, TX",61,214,345,4.0,12/7/2016,"Oh man, their tap beers are pretty good. Light yet still hoppy and dark. Super good. But please don't get their berry blast cider. It was not good at all. It tasted like some energy drink which I hate. Anyways. My bf got the blonde ale which was so much better. Upon opening the drink menu, we ordered the Taster Sampler and asked our waitress to pick some good ones. The taster sampler is the way to go! You can choose and it's more variety. Who doesn't look that? I got the kale salad and my bf got a burger. The food was decent but the beers left a better impression on me. Maybe that's because I haven't drank any beers when I go eat out now?  For dessert, we got the chocolate chunk pizookie which is great as well. Service was good despite us coming in at almost 10 pm. I like how their hours are late so I don't have to drive to Cafe Brazil for some mediocre food and non existent service.  Definitely recommend here for late night, non-breakfast meals! Also, they have reverse happy hour from 9pm-11pm!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Toya H.,"Richardson, TX",0,19,4,3.0,10/8/2017,"Pizooki is good but not worth the huge cost of $6+. Think Papa Johns cookie pie, but only a 1/3 of the size.  I've never dined in, only ordered twice for delivery- which was through Doordash- which is a very fast service and I like it. Last time I ordered they forgot the fries that go w my burger UUUGH (even though there were a few fries somehow stuck to the cheese on my burger) and didn't honor the substitution I asked for, so I guess typing it IN ALL CAPS on the app wasn't good enough.

Shannah H.,"Plano, TX",243,728,1120,4.0,10/23/2016,"I really like BJ's - for a chain, it offers good quality food, consistent service and an easy in-and-out dining experience. The menu is very extensive (ala Cheesecake Factory) and probably could be edited down. That is, if everyone else is like me and tends to order mostly the same things every time they visit.

Annie C.,"Richardson, TX",33,100,363,3.0,1/8/2017,"The service has always been consistently well with patient and understanding staff members. Combined with the beers, service, and atmosphere, this restaurant could have easily been one of my go-to American dine in locations, but the food is the main issue. It is strange how every time I have their baby back ribs, I get food poisoning later that night (moments after consumption) or the next day. That never happens when I eat barbecue, with ribs being my favorite meat to order, so I must say there is some peculiar ingredient(s) in their rub and sauce, both of which taste great and complement the tender meat below.  The food is always the most important part of dining in a restaurant, and because I cannot stomach their food, I am giving BJ's three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Angel M.,"Plano, TX",0,20,,1.0,1/23/2017,"My husband and I have been to this particular BJ's several times. They offer a variety of meals, including some gluten free options, which is wonderful for those who, like myself, have a gluten sensitivity. Food aside, this review is more about the service, or lack there of, each and every time we visit.  My husband and I are young. I'm going to assume this alone gives waiters the impression that they can be a little more lax with us and treat us more like buddies than paying customers. We also both order water because we actually just LOVE water. There is a shift in service after the drink orders as well we've noticed. I suppose they think we are trying to save some dollars where we can? Be cheap customers? Can't say for sure. Our most recent visit was the last straw. My husband and I were seated at the two person booth right next to two tables that sat four. Our server gave great attention to those tables while we were ignored. We had to get our waiters attention to ask for an appetizer because we weren't even asked if we were interested in one.  For the entree my husband asked for tomatoes on his pizza which weren't even there. He told the waiter to which he replied - ""Oh, they are there, they're just really small."" Really? He didn't refill our waters not once even though we put them in clear view at the edge of the table. We were left with empty glasses for the last 20 minutes of us being there. He then walked by to drop off the check in the middle of us eating without saying a word. By the way, we had planned on getting dessert. It would have been nice if this were offered instead of, what felt like, him rushing us out of his section by placing the check down two bites into our entrees. We had to again call his name as he was walking away from one of his two tables of four to ask for dessert...to which he barely acknowledged with a nod before running off.  All around just awful service. My husband used to be a waiter and I worked in the food industry for 6 years. We both understand working for tips, so we always tip well even if it wasn't deserved. It is a shame that we get stereotyped as ""that young couple that probably won't tip well so we shouldn't even bother with giving them great service"". It is frustrating and insulting. ALL customers should be treated equally with great service.  It will be some time before we go back to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano
Patricia S.,"Dallas, TX",2,101,,1.0,3/23/2017,"The trifecta of fails. Once again, after making a reservation AND talking with a ""manager"" our group of 20 had to wait for a table to be made ready for us WHICH took half an hour. But dog forbid they should be ready for people who plan ahead and notify a restaurant that a large party would be arriving on a certain date and time. It WAS nice to see that they had NO problem seating a party of 14 who walked in without a reservation.  Cold food, waiters who had NO idea of where to put the food, ""oh, not finished your soup yet sir, here let me place this plate of ribs on your soup bowl then"".  ""Your turkey burger is cold?

Kartik P.,"Atlanta, GA",52,193,78,2.0,7/7/2016,"I should have not ordered Chicago Deep Dish in Texas. Just like the physical location of Dallas, the pizza was no where close to the deep dish that I know of. It was a bread which was stuck in the oven till it cooks and then topped it off with tomato puree and onions, peppers and meat of your choice. Really thats how you are going to make the deep dish? And moreover you have a full page of menu dedicated to deep dish!  Anyways I would consider it my mistake of expecting something more.  The other party on my table had their soup and they did not seem to have enjoyed it either.

Ginny T.,"Murphy, TX",186,61,111,3.0,7/1/2016,"I recommend coming here to try their hand crafted beers and pizookies.  Bjs has such a diverse menu. From salads and quinoa bowls to pizzas, steaks, wings, pastas, and grilled cheese sandwiches; there's an option for everyone. I really enjoy eating their burgers with wedge fries but I heard their deep dish pizza is a good option as well. Their appetizers are pretty large so feel free to order one to eat as your entree. I recommend getting the grilled chicken flat bread pizza which comes with chicken, tomatoes, avocados, and bacon.  As for their pizookies, they come in two sizes: regular and small. A small is about 3-4inches in diameter and is usually enough for around 3 people to share. My favorite would be the chocolate chunk or white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie but if it's your first time here and you're not quite sure what to get, they have a trio option which allows you to choose 3 different small pizookies with a scoop of icecream on each.    Their service was not the best. The waiter seemed to be in a rush to give us our checks and only refilled our waters twice during our dine in even though we were out of water. We paid before dessert and didn't see our waiter after that, leaving us with no water when the pizookies came out. Pizookies tend to make you thirsty but because we never got refills, we left dehydrated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano

Pam D.,"Addison, TX",156,619,1091,4.0,7/23/2015,"After a long week, some ice cold beer was in order. I knew my husband would enjoy the large, no nonsense selection of food, too.  In comparison to Yard House, a similar concept, BJ's is more family-oriented and less trendy. Yard House usually has 50 or so craft beers, while BJ's focuses more on their own beers and only offers a few craft beers.  We arrived around 6:15pm and as such, we were able to order drinks at the happy hour pricing. I really enjoyed the IPA brewed by BJ's.  We shared a deep dish pizza. Although we were turned off by the pricing - $23 for a large! - I have to admit the pizza was quite good. Unlike traditional Chicago deep dish, the crust has a nice, lightly crunch cook on the outside. The dough and fillings make up a light & fluffy inside. A large is easily splittable by 4 people- or you can take home leftovers like we did.  Our server was great! Very attentive, friendly, and frankly one of the best personalities from a server I've had in a long time. He was really honest about his preference on menu items, which I love from a server.

Any time you and friends can't decide on a place, BJs is a safe bet, serving multiple genres of food.  To further distinguish themselves, BJs is a brewery with decent in house brews! I recommend their heifewiezen for a smooth finish.  I only had two appetizers on this visit: avocado egg rolls and spinach artichoke dip. The egg rolls were great!

Dawn S.,"Plano, TX",385,77,460,3.0,8/19/2015,"Came here for lunch, their prices are good and there's tons of selection on the menu, took me a while to make a selection but I finalized on the half chicken club flat bread with salad for less than $8! The salad was a small portion, pretty simple paired with vinaigrette, the flatbread on the other hand wasn't so good, I think mainly because they flavored it with a lot of ranch sauce, too heavy and it overlaps the natural flavor of the chicken, avocado, and I believe bacon or pepperoni, I ended up having to wipe some of the ranch sauce off.  Service was below average, we waited around a few times not being checked up on, but in their defense, lunch time is a packed house, also when they gave me my flatbread they accidentally swapped my order with a gentlemen from another table... Still gave it to me because apparently he hasn't touched it. Not the most appetizing start but I was starving, after the few waiting periods. I wouldn't recommend BJ's food to anyone, and their service isn't anything you can count on, i'm not a beer drinker and I noticed that's one of the things they're known for, but can't supply much input on that. I don't plan on coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=20

Colin. He had the decency to stop at our table even though he was carrying an arm full of drinks to another table, to ask if we were ok. After we told him we were not having the best experience he sent the manager over. The manager Brandon, was more than apologetic and not only gave us new property cooked entrees but his demeanor was incredibly sympathetic. After that he sent an amazing young man to take care of our needs. Benjamin. Ben was attentive and took care of us in every way. He made sure he checked on our needs frequently. The 3 of these young men made my birthday night out with my husband turn from disappointing to amazing.

Bruce C.,"Richardson, TX",372,609,245,2.0,5/10/2013,"Aw man.  I hate to do this but this is gonna be one of those reviews. We were so hungry.  I had gotten a slurpee late in the afternoon and my stomach was full on high fructose corn syrup.  The Wife came home and was tired so she went to take a nap.  By 8:30, I was getting hungry and she was just getting out of bed.  She was craving pizza so off to BJ's we went. We get there and it's crazy busy.  It's 8:45 and there are still people sitting outside waiting for a table.  We go inside and ask how long the wait is.  ""oh, 15 minutes.""  That's not bad.  So we wait for about 5 minutes and our pager goes off. We sit down and we know we want pizza so we order a half BJ's favorite and half Sweet Pig.  Then we wait.  It feels like forever and the Wife thinks it took about 30 minutes.  It finally comes out and as the server puts it on the pizza stand, I immediately spot a long curly (not kinky, mind you) hair on the pizza. Server: ""Would you like me to serve you your first piece of pizza?"" Me: ""There's a hair on it."" She says, ""Yup,"" and immediately takes it back to the kitchen. The Wife, ""Why'd you say that?!  I'm so hungry."" Me: ""There was a hair.  I couldn't help myself."" So the server comes back and says, ""They're making you another pizza because that is gross."" Me: ""We're so hungry..."" Server: ""Would you like me to bring you a cup of soup or a salad?"" Me: ""What do you have?""  (server lists off soups) ""Oooh clam chowder!"" The Wife: ""I'd like the tomato and mozzarella salad."" The server comes back in like 5 minutes with our starters and I will have to say, this is the best part of our meal.  The chowder was perfect.  I've probably only once had better chowder and that was in San Francisco.  This soup had a TON of clam in it.  It was thick and hearty like it should be and had the perfect texture.  You know how some clam chowder is really thin or it has a ton of potato and no clam?  This was exactly how you would want it. The Wife's salad was very good too.  It was actually a decent sized salad.  She commented that if she wanted a light dinner, this might be enough. Then came the pizza.  I'm sad to say that about 2/3 of the pizza was sweet pig and 1/3 was BJ's favorite at best.  Then of course, there are the overlap areas so technically only about 1/4 of the pizza was strictly BJ's favorite.  I was going to say something but we had already sent a pizza back for the hair and it was just getting too ridiculous.  On top of that, the pizza had been rushed and wasn't baked enough.  The crust was doughy and soggy.  Disappointing at best.  =o/ *sigh* I am very glad that they made up for our hunger with free starters.  That was very classy of them, but rushing the pizza was not the right choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=60

My steak was very good; mashed potatoes were also good; roasted asparagus was the absolute worst asparagus I have ever eaten in my life....dry and zero taste. I requested something else and got corn......equally horrible.....dried out and was like left overs from days back. Very disappointing. No offer of adjustment on our bill was made, & the waitress made no effort to discuss it with the manager. $23 for a meal should mean it is palatable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=80
Clara N.,"Richardson, TX",17,102,7,3.0,12/15/2014,"First time going here. I came with friends around 10ish. When we first entered the place, the waiter was just standing there. No greetings. We had to ask  if we can just sit down anywhere, then the waiter  just walk away, expecting us to follow.. I ordered a sirloin steak dish, because I was really craving for it. But when I received it, I was super disappointed.  I was expecting a round steak, bigger than the size of a palm.. but it was a long skinny one.. like seriously, when I first received the dish, I was staring at the meat like ""what the f***"" . And I was kinda dissatisfied with the sides. I wasn't fond of the mashed potatoes and I wished that they gave me more broccoli. Does it cost extra for more broccoli? SIGH  My friend ordered a chicken tenders dish and the dish was FULL. Compared to my dish,  it was worth the money (about $6-7) while mine was like ($14-15) it can prob feed a kid. We ordered a biegnet for dessert. and it was good! Though there was a lot of whipped cream... and $7 for just one fried dough? :/  Overall BJ's is okay for other dishes beside steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=80

Su L.,"Dallas, TX",186,366,207,3.0,8/15/2013,"Holy macrol this place is jam packed on a Thursday evening. It is insanely crowded and busy. We had friends already seated so we were luckily able to skip the wait. The draft beer is expensive here costing $5-6 for a short so you may as well get a pitcher for $16-17 instead and either look like an alcoholic by yourself or split it amongst you and your friends. Happy hour ends at 7 pm and it is only applicable in the bar area. The calamari here is super tasty and crunchy. And the pizookie (giant cookie in a tin) is a giant tin of happiness with a scoop of ice cream plopped on top. Service is pretty slow and it can take a while to get your drink order, even if it is for a glass of water. Strangely enough, the food orders tend to come out a lot faster than the drink orders.

Jane K.,"Dallas, TX",129,89,68,2.0,1/12/2015,"Where do I begin. Service was absolutely horrible.  I came in to eat a late dinner with a girlfriend of mine. It took a while for us to get greeted, but we didn't think much about it. Our server finally showed up, dropped off coasters and then just walked away. Maybe it's the fact that we're young Asian girls and he thought we'd tip him bad that we had such poor service? But hello! If you give us bad service, you'll get a bad tip. Our server didn't smile at us even once. He looked angry and irritated the whole time. There was even a moment that he asked is ""anything else for you guys?"" while walking away and not looking at us. I've never had such poor service in my life. I would have given this place a straight up one star if it wasn't for the food. The Deep Dish Lasagna was really good and very big in portion (at least in my opinion). I had to take more than half of it home because I couldn't finish. Overall, if I ever come back to this location, I'll sit at the bar or somewhere. Our server needs to learn to smile and check up on us. We felt like he just wanted us out. Also, on a very petty note, I've never had to box up food for myself. The server has always asked if we wanted them to box it up for us. Instead, our server just handed me a box and walked away.

Karen S.,"Carrollton, TX",200,29,14,5.0,12/1/2013,"There are so many things I love about this restaurant (the Plano/75 location) it's hard to know where to start. The service, especially if you know who to ask for, is excellent. I have never had bad service when I ask for someone by name.  Never!  I ask for Lauren M. unless she's tending bar.  She is awesome & deserves 5 stars. Best ever.  Friendly, charming, on top of her game. Jay is great, but he is usually at the bar so I don't sit with him as often since I prefer a booth. Blake is also very good, very efficient and goes the extra mile.  Leah is great and so is Casey.   There are lots of great servers, it's hard to get bad service unless maybe you get a new server or someone is having an off day. The menu offers so many different choices you could eat there for days...even weeks...and not repeat.  I love the clam chowder loaf, all of the burgers, the chili loaf, the onion strings.  The pizza is wonderful and if you love micro-brews, this is the place for you.  The food is always served at the appropriate temperature which I appreciate. I love the atmosphere and usually sit in one of the booths in the bar area which is open seating.  There are also many cozy booths around the edge of the restaurant if you want a less noisy location.  The bar is definitely more noisy than the restaurant, but not outrageously loud. The management is very caring and will walk around to check out the operations.  Michael M. is the GM and he gets to know all the regulars by name.  Michael M's other managers are all good and always willing to help with any problems that might occur, although rarely have I had a problem of any kind. The hot cookie desserts are amazing and not to be missed. Parking is plentiful and free.  The best time to go is right when they open for lunch  which is 10 am on weekends or 11 am during the week.  This restaurant is very popular and in my humble opinion, the best of the BJs in Dallas.  If you go for dinner, especially on the weekends, go early.   They have a wonderful take-out operation so if you want the food, but don't want to wait for a table, you can order and have your food to go very quickly. I have no complaints about this restaurant.  Everything about it is awesome as far as I am concerned.  Not everyone will agree with me but for my needs, it rocks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=80

Erin H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",44,211,23,3.0,10/14/2013,"The BF and I flew out to Dallas to pick up his new Harley then drove back to California. This was the first stop of our journey. This strip of highway has several eating options, including Redneck Heaven (which the man at the Harley dealership enthusiastically recommended) but we decided on BJ's simply because we were starving and we were close.  It was around 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't busy and there was no wait...well, not for a table, at least. We did have to wait about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us standing by the hostess stand, and when they did greet us, they offered no apology for the wait. Instead, the young man who came to the desk looked at us and said, ""how can I help you?"" Uh, a table so we can eat would be a good start? Not sure what the purpose of asking this question was...very strange.  Anyway, once we were seated our waitress came over and took our drink order. A few (10 or so) minutes later she came back and took our food order and brought the drinks. We ordered a deep dish vegetarian pizza with chips and salsa to start.  The chips and salsa were kind of weird, the chips weren't crispy. More soggy and very salty. The salsa was okay though. The pizza came out a while later and it was fine. Nothing great, but not bad either. It was bigger than we were expecting so we only ended up eating a few slices each.  We weren't offered refills on drinks or dessert so we just paid the bill and left.

The steak was overcooked and so tough that we could barely cut into it. The runner who brought out our food said ""steak"" and ""pulled pork"" and left without another word. The steak we sent back and the manager who came to drop off a burger instead didn't say a word either. When the check came the steak was still on it. We have both worked in the service industry and understand mistakes happen. This was just a bad display all around. Everyone just seemed to have better things to do. Definitely one of the worst restaurant visits I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=120
Zamora R.,"Garland, TX",104,14,1,1.0,5/30/2015,Had lunch here today with my family. Thought it was a good choice since they have such a variety on their menu. First we had calamari my children saw the picture thought it looked good. When it came to the table is full of tentacles rather than rings. Nothing like the photo and Not only was it only tentacles but they were overcooked and hard. Then came our meals I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger. Figured safe bet you can't mess up a burger well I was wrong. The bottom bun was hard the tomatoes looked old the lettuce was Wilted and the cheese was so burned it didn't even look like cheese. And the meat  was like roadkill flat full of holes it didn't even take up the bread. My four-year-old refused to eat it I decided to take one for the team and not complain and eat it and since then I have done nothing but taste my food for the last five hours. I feel so sick I would never go there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=120

Again, another 10 minutes to get our waters and another 10 minutes for him to come back to take our order.

Husband and I stopped by @ 11am to avoid lunch rush.  I ordered the FAMOUS root beer to give it a try.  We ordered fried calamari, sandwich and soup and flat bread pizza/salad lunch special. - ROOT BEER:  not as good as I expected since there wasn't enough carbonation.  I still like IBC root beer over BJ's. - FRIED CALAMARI:  Like others have reviewed BJ's calamari, I agreed with them.  It wasn't crunchy at all.  It's more on the soft side.  Also, later guests calamari plate looks more than what we had, theirs look full while ours were half the amount.  My husband guessed that our plate was not full since we were the 1st ones.  Very disappointed in taste and portion. - CHILI with sandwich combo: The chili was ok.  Why?  It wasn't hot when it came out and the taste didn't stand out in flavor or anything.  Taste like it came out of a can.  Sorry BJ's.

Michael C.,"Plano, TX",33,170,18,5.0,7/22/2012,"BJ's delivers well on what it tries to be, a brewhouse that serves food. It's a great place for lunch because they have a host of great deals and they tend to get you in and out reasonably quickly.  It can be a bit loud or distracting, so intimate/romantic chats may best be held elsewhere...but it IS a brewhouse after all. On that note, grabbing a quick bite and a beer at the bar also works great.  If you want to watch sports, they have a quartet of giant screens right over the bar and some redundant ones scattered about the restaurant. For brews, my favorite is the Jeremiah Red, a full flavor and it does not hurt that it is the strongest beer they have. For meals, I like and heartily recommend the following, if you want some advice: - Ahi Tuna Salad -  There is not a ton of protein in there, but it's very good; beware the wasabi, they made it pretty strong last time I tried it - Baby Back Pork Ribs - the meat slides right off the bone, you can eat this dish with fork) - Half Sandwich & Soup - I like to specifically get it with the Turkey Cobb & Clam Chowder - Garden Medley Salad (add Salmon) - I would add salmon to this occasionally, but it's great alone; which is good, because I believe they use farm-raised Salmon, of which one can only eat to much (because of PCBs, not mercury)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=120

Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,66,2.0,10/16/2012,"Well.......... as much as I hate writing negative reviews and the fact that I have been to BJ's on several occasions in the past with groups from work and had a nice time, I just can't let our latest experience pass by without mention.   Last week, hubs and I were craving pizza, which we always either make ourselves or order in, but instead said ""where can we go to sit down and have get a good pizza?""  Then it hit me, I remembered having great pizza at BJ's in past years with our friends from work.   So, off we go, looking forward to a yummie pie and some great cocktails & beer.  We ordered a pizza with EXTRA sauce and several toppings, an apple martini made with vodka, apple pucker & Midori (the original appletini recipe) and a Blue Moon beer.  Our waiter was obviously new and took his time getting out our drinks, but that's OK, completely understandable.  But, then the pizza arrived with NO sauce......  we both took a few bites and then realized what was wrong, so we explained the problem to our waiter and another pizza was promptly ordered and the original removed.   Still enjoying our drinks, they were just about gone by the time the second pizza arrived.  So another round of drinks was ordered and we dove into the pizza - we were starving at this point.   One mouth full and all our excitement about pizza night out were gone.  This one had a little bit of sauce but was undercooked as well.  It was edible, but just not what we had anticipated or what we had ordered, so we went with and enjoyed our second drink.  About 3/4 finished with the second pizza, our waiter arrives to ask if everything was good.  We explained to him the disappointment with the pizza again and he said he was sorry, etc, etc - the same BS you get from every waiter - they really don't give a RA if you enjoyed your food - they are only trained to ask this.   So, anyway we were now ready for the check and that's where things got hairy..........  We get the bill and just happened to notice we were charged for two appletinis and two ""shots"" of Midori for a total of $30 for two drinks! (No way was there an ""shot"" of Midori in my appletini.   So, my first complaint would be that there are no prices on the menu for alcohol and we were not told that requesting Midori to replace the cheap and carb-loaded ""sweet & sour"" they add for their non-traditional appletinis would add an additional $7.50 per drink.  That, on top of the really bad pizza, called for a meeting with the manager.   The manager arrived promptly to explain the cost of the Midori.  He and I had a rather heated discussion that there was not the volume of a ""shot"" in each drink to justify the charge and I asked they be removed.   He hesitated, so I explained it to him like this...... either he remove the Midori charges or he could remove the entire pizza since it was awful and had to be ordered twice.   He then agreed to remove the Midori's (of course - as they were the cheaper road to travel).  Had this happen, you would not be reading this review......... instead he removed ONE Midori and presented us with a $10 gift certificate for a return visit.   Well, that just doesn't work for me.   Don't lie to me and then try to cover the lie with the addition of a gift card.   We have no desire to return to BJ's and will pass the card on to a friend.......... or trash it - one of the two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=140

Jordan H.,"Wylie, TX",11,105,20,3.0,7/3/2011,"I found myself at this restaurant for the first time (both in location and the chain itself) last weekend while having lunch with friends. I was assured that the food was good and the brewed drinks were even better.  First of all, the environment and ambience of BJ's was pretty nice, featuring a more upscale and adult vibe than your average, Chili's-esque dine-in restaurant. This was so much the case that BJ's definitely seemed out of place while sharing a parking lot with a grimy Jack-in-the-Box and strip mall.  For drinks I sampled both the root beer and an Irish root beer (alcoholic), two of the many drinks they brew in house. While the Irish root beer was a delicious and clever combination of ingredients, the regular version was nothing to write home about. It was good, but nothing in it's taste or composure really set it apart from other root beers - except the price.  The food was good and there were a lot of options to choose from, some of which were things you wouldn't find on any other menu in town. Their deep dish pizza's are deliciously fresh and have a professional homemade quality to them. I had a GIANT baked potato stuff with chicken (which was overwhelmingly of the canned/processed/cubed variety), broccoli, and cheese while my husband enjoyed the parmisiano pasta. All dishes were really delicious (but not extraordinary or super amazing).  The major con with BJ's was the price. One soda and two of the cheapest entree's on the menu still cost us $30, which is pretty uncomfortable for those on the budget. But if that price range is comfortable for you, then by all means don't listen to me complain about it. Other than that, the service was mostly adequate, considering the restaurant was at about a medium-heavy occupancy.  Depending on the weight of my wallet I would definitely consider eating here again in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=160
Ron G.,"Allen, TX",120,254,7,2.0,8/15/2008,"Well, I'm going to have to drop my rating a couple of stars. In the past few weeks I have twice taken my team to lunch here. Both times the meal service was completely disinterested, slow, and somewhat random. Everyone's food arrived over a long period of time. The servers never said anything about why or when the food would be out. Drink refills were never offered nor was anyone ever asked if their meal was OK. On the most recent visit things were so bad I complained to the guy passing himself off as a manager. At first he denied anything had gone wrong. But then offered a big discount off the meal plus a gift card along with an admission of failed service. If it hadn't happened twice I would have let it go.

Rick O.,"Dallas, TX",22,119,1,4.0,5/17/2011,"For a chain joint, it's a bit pricey, but the food is really good. And if you sit at the bar, the TV setup is very nice for sports hounds. Since the demise of the Stone Elephant a few months back, I've had to range far and wide to find a decent stand-in. I found myself up here in Plano a couple of times in the past couple of weeks, and I left a happy man. The beer selection is quite good - on top of their home-brew stuff - so I was able to enjoy the Saint Arnold IPA on draft. Not cheap, but very good if you like IPA. Their pizza is all kinds of awesome. We got the Mediterranean, topped with grilled chicken, roasted garlic, Kalamatta olives, and feta cheese. Picture the good parts of a Greek salad strewn atop a fluffy, buttery crust. I'm drooling just thinking back to it now. Mmmmmm... On my return trip, I had the California Chicken sandwich. The avocado, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, AND ranch dressing melt into gooey mess, but the sourdough bread keeps things mostly contained. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked - tender and moist. I'm going to out on a limb and say it challenges Kenny's for Best Chicken Sandwich Ever. Write it down. I'm knocking off a star just because they seem to be a little proud of what is essentially jazzed up bar fare. Very good bar fare, mind you, but essentially pizza, burgers and sandwiches. The atmosphere is nice, and the service is great. It has kind of a ""Houston's Lite"" feel to it. So maybe that's their justification.

Ambiance: We typically sit in the bar area, but the entire restaurant is very open and airy.  It's a great place to unwind after a long day at work or to relax with friends.  Despite being quite crowded at times the noise level is quite manageable.  Expect a wait during peak times. Service:  The service in the bar area is great.  The servers are friendly, attentive, and have a great attention to detail for a place like this.  The few times we've had issues with our food they're always quick to notice and correct the problem. Food: The menu is ridiculously large and offers more than enough options.  We typically stick with the deep dish pizzas which are great.  The crust is nice and buttery and the toppings are plentiful.  I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken and the BJ's Favorite.  Every appetizer we have tried has been good as well.  The food always arrives hot and tastes fresh.  The highlight of the meal though is always the pizookie for dessert.  A warm gooey cookie with ice cream - doesn't get much better than that!  That being said, the ""original"" chocolate chip version is my least favorite - the triple chocolate with vanilla ice cream or the peanut butter with some hot fudge are the way to go!  Skip the apple crisp; it's not that great.  Prices: I think the prices are fair based on the portion sizes and quality of food.  This is definitely a step up from a Friday's or Chili's and it shows.  They also offer some good happy hour specials in the bar area M-F.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=160

Brittany G.,"Irving, TX",57,119,18,2.0,3/26/2014,"Awful. One of my grandparents' favorite restaurants is BJs and we come here often. Thankfully this wasn't our first trip or we wouldn't be back. Although, we will probably not give our business to this location anymore related to the lackadaisical manager. So we arrived at 5pm on a Saturday, beers came out quickly and we ordered at 5:10. By 5:50 I'm looking around for our server to ask why it is taking our food so long. Finally at 5:55 it arrives. I had subbed my fries for broccoli and you should have seen the amount I got. 3 pieces as a side? Not to mention it was cold! Both my grandmother and grandfather's food was cold as well. So we get our server and explain the situation (and also that the 3 twenty something's at the table were servers) and I ask to speak to a manager. This guy didn't tell me his name, but he was a heavy set middle aged white guy with glasses. He could not have given two shits less about everything and instead went off on a tangent with my grandpa about wedge fries vs thin cut fries. My grandmother not wanting to create a problem said her food was ""edible"" and in the restaurant world that screams FIX IT! When he left the table I was fuming more than before! I told our server (who was very helpful and caught in the middle of a situation out of his control) that his manager was useless and could not have cared less. Our new sides arrived (still ridiculously small), my grandma ate her cold pasta and we left. The manager took my sandwich off the bill, but honestly if he had just acted like he cared more I wouldn't have even wanted that. At that point he needed to do more than take off a $9 sandwich though because not only did he not fix the situation, he multiplied my anger. At the end of the day the beer and service by our waiter was good, but the food and attitude of the manager ruined everything.

Glaser J.,"San Diego, CA",60,123,13,3.0,7/20/2010,"Went here recently with a group of guys from work.  What better way to celebrate a significant work milestone than by drinking at 1PM... Beers here are not too bad.  Not as good as my favorite microbrews, but good nonetheless. My favorites are either the Piranha Pale Ale (crisp and hoppy) or the Jeremiah Red (malt smooth), depending on what I'm in the mood for. Can you call yourself a brewhouse if you don't actually brew beer here?  Oh wait, root beer is brewed here.  Nevermind, carry on..... but seriously, I was told BJ's has their beers brewed at an Anheuser-Busch facility, but the BJ's brewmasters oversee the operations.  Hey, it tastes better than the Anheuser-Busch beers, that's for sure. As far as the food, I like the calamari.  Burgers here are ok.  But their ice cream topped cookies are what I look forward to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180

Scott C.,"Dallas, TX",21,84,,4.0,9/10/2009,"Since I'm a life long fan of Humperdinks and after my scathing review of them I feel so dirty going over to the competitor.  However, if Humperdinks isn't going to get their food right, I need somewhere to go when I need to eat. BJs is a national chain so I feel double dirty for not staying local.  I've had the pizza, the spring rolls and now one of the smothered burgers and, of course, the beer. The beer is the thing. I've had the red and pale ale and the porter. All good.  The pizza is deep dish and a little too deep. If you like a loaf of bread with toppings then you'll love it. OK, its not that bad, but it does rise a lot and is a very thick but airy crust. Its a little different than what I like but I can't really fault it. Next time I want to try the appetizer thin crust pizza. The other food I've had is also good but not outstanding just good and consistent. I don't want BJs to become my default place when I want food and craft brew but for now it may have to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180
Jon L.,"Richardson, TX",0,9,1,1.0,12/2/2013,Their so called deep dish pizza is a joke. It cost $25 bucks for their large deep dish. I've tasted better frozen pizzas found at the grocery store.

Natalie S.,"Plano, TX",9,71,,3.0,4/3/2010,"BJ's is pretty standard ""American"" food; greasy goodness in large portions. We've ordered the deep dish Mediterranean pizza a few times and, though the first few slices are pretty good, the grease on the bottom of the crust gets to be too much after a while; I'm not sure whether it's olive oil or butter that the crust is saturated with, but man is it greasy.  As far as sandwiches and burgers go, their roast beef dip and California chicken sandwich are pretty good. The burger melt is gooey, greasy and cheesy, which is exactly what you want when you order something called a ""melt."" All sandwiches and burgers come with your choice of fries. I like their thin cut fries, but if you like a thicker fry, they also have wedges. We've eaten in the restaurant, carried-out, and had them deliver. When we've eaten there, the service has been pretty good, even when they were swamped; I don't think we've ever had an issue. Both times we did carry-out, something was missing or incorrect in our order. Bummer. As for their delivery service, they charge a fee, which is lame. I can't remember the exact amount, but I want to say it's in the $2-$3 range. Because of that, I have only had them deliver once; I don't live all that far from the restaurant, and, though delivery is always more convenient, it's just not worth it to me. All in all, BJ's is about what you'd expect it to be. The prices are pretty reasonable, and the food is ok. Solid 3.25.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180
David D.,"Plano, TX",14,18,,3.0,4/30/2010,"Went here with a few friends of mine. This is my second time being here at this location. The second time was the better than the first. The first time I went they ran out of ice cream for the pizookie. I know! how can you run out of ice cream?! They had ice cream this time so it was all good ;) A few things: Service here is a bit slow. We've waited for our food for quite some time. I must say, their bar is pretty darn nice. They have a good collection of alcohol beverages on display. Food is not bad. It's actually pretty good. I only got dessert the first time I went so I wasnt sure how the food was. Their deep dish pizza is the BOMB. I was quite surprised. Be warned, If you're a health freak, the pizza is greasyyyyyyy.   So my favorite pizookie is the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream on top. This thing melts in your mouth with every bite. One of my favorite desserts around the area.  Other than that, BJ's is not over the top. It's a fancier Chili's basically. It's good though, so do check it out :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180
Rick G.,"Austin, TX",1,22,1,3.0,1/20/2009,"My son and I visited one Monday evening when we were bach-ing it.    The server, Christina, brought drinks quickly and was attentive throughout. My son order a turkey cobb sandwich with skinny fires.   The fries were very flavorful but also very greasy.  He really enjoyed the sandwich. I had the minestrone soup to start.  I ordered the strip steak with a baked potato - pretty standard fare and not to difficult.   The soup was tasty but thin for minestrone.   The steak was alright - nothing spectacular.   Since it was his birthday, the server provided their signature desert -  a pazookie.  Yeah, if you are looking for sweet overload, this is for you.  It's like a freshly baked cookie smothered in ice cream.   So if I was Randy on AI, I would have to say it was a-yit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180
Megan M.,"Dallas, TX",583,320,381,3.0,11/5/2008,"BJ's isn't bad.  But despite the name, it doesn't rock my world.  However, my lunch buddy loves their veggie pizza so I indulge her once and a while. Most of their dishes are overpriced for lunch, but they do have a few items that are reasonable.  I got the sandwich/salad combo - 1/2 turkey Cobb sandwich, wedge cut fries and a house salad w/garlic ranch, which was pretty tasty.  Add an iced tea and it was $10 after tax.  Not bad at all. The service can be a little slow at times, but it's a huge place and it fills up quickly so I try to give them a break on that.  If you do plan on going for lunch - and only have an hour for lunch - don't even try to show up after 11:45 or so.  The wait for a table and possible slow service almost insures you won't make it back to work in under an hour. I've never been able to try BJ's for dinner, which also means that I've never been able to try their many flavors of beer.  Maybe that's what I've been missing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180

Christopher L.,"Garland, TX",94,134,,2.0,8/1/2009,"I'm sure I'll have to update this later when I go back for real food. But my first experience here was, quite frankly, a bit laughable. We had stopped in for Pizookies, initially having had a craving for the, now closed, Cheddars' cookie monster. At 11 at night, what else should we be going to BJ's for, right?... Anywho, we were gonna split a dessert apiece, after each ordering drinks. Our waitress was nice at least, if not a little hurried. She then informed us that kitchen had run out of vanilla ice cream. This is a shame, when all of the menu desserts have it in their descriptors, but I digress. We opted for chocolate ice cream instead. The craving for Pizookies was great. The Triple Chocolate Chunk PZ was good. The Oreo one I got on the other hand was a little disappointing. It should probably have just been called a Too Much Chocolate In Your Face. I am still convinced that vanilla might have saved it. The greatest foul up though was in waiting for our group's last Pizookie to come out. After four of us were finished eating the two that had already arrived, a manager brought out the fourth, sans the ice cream -- chocolate, vanilla, or any other. And after setting it before my two guys, he made as if to walk away hastily. Only at the objection of my friend did he double back to our table and inform us that the kitchen had also run out of chocolate ice cream. It took asking the waitress to see if the dessert would still be charged to us, seeing as how it was essentially only a large, sugary White Chocolate Macadamia Cookie. Good day to you, BJ's. I SAID GOOD DAY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-plano?start=180

Two ordered gluten free pizza (personal size) and they advised they were delicious. The calzone and chicken fried streaks were very good. Hamburgers were large and juicy. One down side. the menu stated they had chicken wings, so an order was placed. What they served was not ""chicken wings"" but chicken nuggets. I rechecked the menu and it still stated chicken wings. Thought I was being served at a fast food joint. While the Chicken nuggets were delicious they are not ""wings"" need to change your menu. Prices are a little steep.

Sadly, we have seen a steady decline in service and quality. This was made abundantly clear when 5 of us decided to have lunch there on Oct 10th to celebrate a birthday. Beverage glasses were left empty, refills were few and far between. the appetizer we ordered was over done and not very good. entree's were delivered one or two at a time over a period of 20+ minutes. a nice easy work lunch took nearly two hours, the food was cold, the service really lacking.

The service was also great. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful. I totally didn't think that this place gets so many people. I called to be on the waiting list 35 minutes before we got there and once we did get there we had to wait another 20 minutes. Overall, I guess it was worth the wait.
