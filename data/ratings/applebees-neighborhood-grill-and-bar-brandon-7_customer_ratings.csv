2,KeepThemAccountable G.,"Prosser, WA",13,83,7.0,1.0,2014-08-17,"I thought Applebees was only a domestic cullinary disaster...turns out it is an international cullinary abomination. The bartender did not know how to make a martini, the bahama mama was made from children's cough medicine, the margarita was super green (still trying to figure that one out), and the beers are served warm.  The spinach artichoke dip literally choked you, the signature southwest airlines fiesta wrap was a freshly frozen disaster.  The waitress was super cool and I hope she finds a respectable establishment to work for soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brandon-7,,,,,
0,Cam D.,"Brandon, Canada",0,6,,3.0,2015-06-20,"Updated menu and as always great deserts. The staff are friendly and the prices are a little steep but this is an American chain and they will always gouge Canadians, because we continue to pay. It is a typical sports bar/restaurant but the food and deserts are worth going for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brandon-7,,,,,
1,Anna J.,"Eugene, OR",0,56,15.0,4.0,2016-07-20,This seemed to be your standard good food for a chain restaurant. The wait staff were capable and nice. The air conditioning was perfect for such a hot day. We had the steak and potatoes which was perfect since all we had been eating were turkey sandwiches. I would recommend this establishment after camping for a week.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-brandon-7,,,,,
