Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1004,3191,5.0,10/18/2017,"Some nights I like to be adventurous and try an new restaurant. But a lot of the time (especially when I'm with my hubby) we just want something stress free that never fails to satisfy us completely. So we come here to Cheesecake Factory! This location gave us a particularly awesome server. I wish I'd gotten his name because he was one of the most over-the-top professional and sweet servers I've ever had. He was a young gentleman, quite tall....I hope you get him when you visit. He's great at checking in to make sure everything is to your liking. We were so impressed by him that we mentioned him to the manager on the way out. We're definitely going back to this location! Our go-to appetizer is the ""Spicy"" Chicken Loaded Nachos. It's big enough to share and tastes absolutely perfect. I love that it has both cheese sauce and melted shredded cheese. Also, the seasoning on the chicken is so good! But we have many other favorite options - any other the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls or even the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  If you want something on the healthy side, they have some pretty epic salads. Try the Greek or the Cobb.  For dessert we always order two to share. A recent combo I particularly enjoyed was Oreo and S'mores. But we're also pretty obsessed with Reese's. The Dulche De Leche, Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut and Salted Caramel are all amazing as well! And if you don't want Cheesecake, go with the Godiva Brownie Sundae - it's huge!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek
Chanda H.,"Dayton, OH",32,11,4,3.0,9/9/2017,"This used to be my favourite place but not anymore  They have severe hygiene issues with tables , chairs ,plates and cutlery , we were taken back on the booth which ready to be seated but not wiped off with crumbs all over and some greasy stuff on it and when I asked to clean she just dusted off some and asked me to sit and I had to ask her to wipe it off with water  Another time I was sitting in the booth when a chewing gum got stuck to my pants from under the table  It might not be their fault that some one put it there but checking cleanliness us their job  These things just loose the apetite",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek
Marc M.,"Maineville, OH",0,11,15,1.0,5/15/2017,"This restaurant is located at the Greene in Beavercreek, and being part of a larger shopping center needs to be attentive to people's time as many if it's patrons are on lunch break from the many stores. That being said I waited at the reception desk for 6 minutes while the girl behind the counter was on the phone. No worries, she has to answer the phone, but then have someone come support her. I was seated, and then low and behold, another 6 minutes to get the server to come greet me. 12 of 60 minutes gone so far and haven't placed my order yet. Order came out 17 minutes later, so that was fine. I ordered a mushroom burger without grilled onions and unsalted fries. Burger came out with onions and of course salt on the fries.  Shanequa was my server and she was very sweet and attentive, she just didn't have a chance to truly done being let down as she was by the rest of the experience. Food was hot and tasty, just not as ordered.  Overall I would avoid and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek
Liana N.,"Honolulu, HI",121,116,797,4.0,8/16/2016,"I am huge fan of Cheesecake Factory and have visited numerous times. It is a chain restaurant and is located throughout the U.S. This one is located at the Greene and is on the corner right when you enter on Indian Ripple.  What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is their consistency with their food, presentation, quality, and service. There are often deals on free slices of cheesecake during the holidays when you purchase a $25 gift card.  I have tried many items on the menu and my go to choices are typically Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, Chicken Madeira, any of their huge salads, hamburgers, or Renee's Special with Chicken Salad sandwich. All of their portions are huge and you will definitely have left overs. This is a place to share with your friends and family. Don't forget to save some room for their iconic cheesecake as well!  For this visit, I had Renee's Special with Chicken Salad sandwich. I love ordering this one because it comes with a little bit of everything. It includes the chicken salad sandwich, spring salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and their soup of the day. Their soup of the day was cream of mushroom.  If you are not feeling like soup, you can always substitute it for something else for no extra charge. I have substituted my soup for french fries or mashed potatoes before.   Have I mentioned that I'm a big fan of this restaurant yet? I have almost tried all of their cheesecakes already and my favorites are Tuxedo, Kahlua, and Godiva. Although I have a sweet tooth, I do try to have some self-control and share with my hubby. :)    And yes, every time I enter Cheesecake Factory, my eyes dart directly to the cheesecakes in the display case and can feel like I have gained 10 pounds before my meal. I definitely recommend coming here if you are visiting the Greene.  If you visit during the weekends during the dinner rush, expect to wait for an hour or possibly more. There is also brunch on Sunday as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek
Jessica L.,"Columbus, OH",9,133,373,3.0,11/14/2016,"It's no secret that Cheesecake Factory has some pretty tasty (and super fatty) meals and appetizers to choose from within their HUGE menu, so I'm not going to go into too much detail regarding the food...just know that it's pretty good. Large portions, tons of options, decent prices, beautiful restaurant interior. 'Nuff said! Their famous desserts, however, are the real reason I keep revisiting to try some new things. This time I ordered a Hot Chocolate beverage and the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Pie Cheesecake and my husband had the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. I must say, I wasn't blown away with any of these choices. The hot chocolate was pretty but had NO FLAVOR at all. Tasted like hot water. No sweetness, no chocolate explosion that I was desperately hoping for. Very disappointing. The pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake was good but not amazing. The pumpkin pie part didn't have a ton of pumpkin flavor, but the pecan pie base was gooey and tasty at least. The white chocolate raspberry was incredibly subtle, which my husband enjoyed but I personally like a distinct pop of flavor on my tongue and I just didn't get it with any of these desserts this visit. My previous visit I ordered Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which sounds similar to German chocolate cake. This has been the biggest disappointment so far. It was served to me in the restaurant ice cold, so I could barely get my fork through it, and it tasted way too much like super fake coconut. Huge bummer since I absolutely adore the chocolate, coconut & nut mixture of most German chocolate items, but this tasted like a rock dipped in coconut tanning lotion. Not good at all. I will say that my most favorite dessert I've had at Cheesecake Factory so far is the Salted Caramel Cheesecake (Heaven on a plate!!!!) so maybe I'll just stick to that from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek
Krystle C.,"Dayton, OH",4,19,29,5.0,8/26/2017,Love the Cheesecake Factory. Today I brunched with a friend (though Brunch is only on Sunday).

Jennifer H.,"Mountain View, CA",0,16,,1.0,10/6/2017,"Decided to stop in tonight for some dessert. Got seated on the patio immediately and waited for a waiter. Then we waited some more. After 10 minutes we asked for a waiter or waitress. Waited some more. Finally someone showed up. We asked for 2 waters and ordered dessert. After another 15 of waiting and getting neither water nor our order, we left. We told the hostess, but were afraid if we asked for a manager it would take too long!

Cheryl L.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,,1.0,2/15/2017,"Well I am quite disappointed.   My daughter decided to have her birthday dinner here this evening.  It was the WORST experience.   We waited 30 minutes after we arrived at 8pm to be seated at the furthest table in the back next to a door with very little light, the street light outside provided the most light for our table (BTW... Plenty of far more desirable tables open and set for service on our journey to the depths of the earth).  Next we ordered and I ordered the carbonara as I always do when we dine here.. NEVER AGAIN.   They should be embarrassed  by the dish they sent out to me.  I immediately took a bite even though it didn't look right(but like I said I could hardly see) the pasta was a dried out mess with oil on it.   Its like they had cooked the pasta an hour before and it sat out to dry.   HORRIBLE!!   I sent it back and our server Alyssa B. said she would talk to the kitchen manager.   Clearly she didn't or maybe she did and the kitchen manager was cool with sending out a second bowl of crap (I even asked her if the kitchen manager thought the second dish was acceptable... I got the impression that she never alerted the kitchen mgr) .   I returned that too and asked to speak to a manager.   I sat waiting for a manager while my family finished their meals.   NO MANAGER EVER CAME!!   CAN YOU BELIEVE?!?!   I asked for the bill and called off the MANAGER  since they didn't care enough about their guest to even make an appearance. Our server Alyssa B.  laughed through out her entire apology but guess what she still got her 20% because that's what people in the business do.   Yep,  I have been in the restaurant business my entire life and I can't even fathom being a manager that would let a guest out the door without even a care as to what went horribly wrong in their restaurant.   UNBELIEVABLE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek

Taylor M.,"Anna, OH",4,42,24,4.0,3/5/2017,"The decor was very nice. We came at 4:30 and there was already a huge wait so we walked around the Greene as we waited. There are many vegan and vegetarian options and many dishes can be modified for vegan or vegetarian consumption. I got Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, the pasta was okay but dry and didn't seem to be cooked all the way. The house side salad was extremely good and the balsamic vinaigrette was extremely amazing to. My family ordered many great drinks and the tropical smoothie was amazing too. Our waiter was extremely funny and just an all around great nice guy. The lights were really dim but other than that the place was great and the food was okay, no one else had complaints about their food or their pasta so I assumed mine was just a fluke and next time I'll try something else.

J W.,"Dayton, OH",158,146,223,4.0,8/3/2014,"I've never had a meal here I didn't like. The wide variety of entree options means everyone can find something they like, even picky eaters. Some of my go-to favorites are Shepard's Pie, Mac 'n cheeseburger, and Jambalaya. The real stars of this restaurant are of course the cheesecakes. I'll go out of my way to get a slice to go a few times a week.  There are a few reasons I won't give this place a 5 star review: 1) even though you get large portions I still find almost everything on the menu to be very overpriced. 2) they do not take reservations and I've been told several times that they won't seat you until everyone in your party arrives",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek

The food was yummy as always. I enjoyed my chipotle chicken pasta dish. It was prepared well and was a good portion size. My husband, however, ordered a bowl of the white chicken chili and the bowl wasn't even full. When you order a $12 bowl of soup you expect it to be full. The meal total came to $120 for the 4 of us. This was with one alcoholic drink and 3 cheesecakes to go. I enjoyed my food but I walked out thinking it wasn't worth the money we spent.

Emily W.,"Dayton, OH",153,105,88,4.0,1/30/2015,"I got the lemon garlic shrimp dish and it tasted just, ""all right."" There was fresh basil in it which was nice, but other than that no flavor really popped out to me at all. It was kind of bland. And the shrimp that cane with it had nice flavor but was cooked in the Shell and it was very difficult to get all the shell bits of, so for me it wags a a bit unappetizing. It came with asparagus which was cooked perfectly. I was just expecting a little more quality (peeled shrimp) and goodness (a little more flavor) from my dish seeing as how it was $18 Our server was excellent and paid close attention to our every need. The manager on duty was very attentive and friendly and stopped by our table many time to check in and visit with my one and a half year old niece who was waving to him everytime he walked by. He noticed her getting a little antsy and two minutes later he showed up with a small bowl of ice cream and sprinkles which she devoured! That was a very thoughtful unexpected treat for my niece and it was very much appreciated.  The cheesecakes, as usual, we're awesome! Our table got three slices, the mango keylime, the dulce de leche and caramel (my favorite), and the turtle cheesecake.

Instead of combining tables to form a larger one for groups larger than 4, they make you wait for the designated larger tables for parties of 6 or 8...the system works so great it eliminates improv (err...or risk I assume).

The cheesecake is pricey but always phenomenal. The seating at this particular location can be hella wonky if you have more than 4 people in your party. Example: we were a party of 7 with 2 members of said party being 6'2 230 lbs and 6'4 260lbs. They actually tried to seat us in a 4-6 person booth. Yeah. Then the hostess got major attitude because we dared to suggest that it wasn't going to work. Then we were led around the entire crowded restaurant like the march of shame and left standing there before they seated us at an appropriate sized table that was empty when we first got there. There were other ugh seating moments but that was the worst. Also, be prepared for Pasta Problems. On one visit their pasta maker was down, so no pasta dishes. Today we waited over 40 minutes because the guy who makes the pasta quit mid-shift lol On a more positive note, our servers have always been very nice and professional.

Alexander C.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,2,2.0,10/18/2016,"I didn't think my experience at this Cheesecake Factory could be worse. I was here about a month ago and I had a similar problem. The servers cannot handle a 5 table section which is standard at most restaurants. I was in on Saturday for the Ohio state game and sat at the hightops near the bar. The problems started stacking o top of each other. First I try to order a pizza and our server insist on not getting anything out the oven because the cook at that station apparently "" sucks "". Very unprofessional from an employee to say things like that to a customer. Anyways, I decide to order the chicken pizza anyways because I've been craving it since the last time I had it. Normally the pizza is fantastic, but this time I swear the whole thing was so undercooked that every single price was unable to tear from the pizza. The crust would just pull off! After not seeing my server for fifteen minutes , my friend who also got a pizza ( which was perfectly fine) was finished with his meal and my server finally comes to the table. I tell her about the pizza and she apologizes and walks around with the pizza in her hand for 20 more minutes before taking my order again. Finally I order my chipotle chicken pasta which is another one of my favorites.. the pasta was literally swimming in sauce. Pasta is not supposed to be drowned guys! My fork was also an issue. I couldn't believe how many things went wrong. My fork was literally bent at the tips and in the dark light it could hurt someone's mouth! And after another ten minutes goes by I see my server , tell her about the problem and she huffs and puffs about it. In the end I ate a cold pasta. My pizza was messed up. And my server had no idea on what serving a table meant. There's not even a manager on sight to complain. Food here is very inconsistent.

Now, this review must come with a fairly large caveat.  We had a large group in our party--9 of us, in all, which includes one late attendee.  However, you'd figure that a place as a big as the Cheesecake Factory would be able to accommodate this well?  Well...in truth?  Not so much. The service at this Cheesecake Factory was absent-minded and barely competent.  Numerous errors occurred throughout our meal:  we were brought incorrect appetizers twice, special requests (no salt on a margarita for the birthday boy's father, who's on heart medication) were ignored.  My wife's Garlic Noodles with Shrimp were sent back twice, because there were no shrimp on the plate!  Our bills were similarly messy, with Jules' and my bill being the only one totally correct.   In each case, the waitress did, in fact, do her best to rectify the situation, but the sheer number of mess-ups made the meal a frustrating experience. That said, the food was pretty tasty.  The Crispy Cuban Rolls were a neat take on the classic Cuban sandwich, with a delightfully zingy mustard and a flavorful pork filling.  My four-cheese pasta was competently done, with plenty of cheese and chicken.  A friend's ""Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp"" smelled pretty fantastic, with a delectably scented curry surrounding a massive mound of sticky rice.  Our cherry cheesecake--taken to go!--was creamy with good flavor and a solid amount of cherry preserves. Under normal circumstances, when I review a restaurant, good food + lousy service tends to result in a 2 or 3-star review.  In this case, as you can see above...no. You see, I woke up this morning feeling a little under the weather.  I stepped out of the shower this morning and almost immediately started heaving over the toilet.  Out came my dinner, the cheesecake, and everything else I'd eaten yesterday.   No amount of good flavor forgives food poisoning.  Avoid, avoid, avoid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=40

Jenny C.,"Dayton, OH",82,227,258,3.0,8/25/2014,"Getting to and from the Greene is incredibly simple. It's conveniently located off the highway (not sure what it is- I'm not from the area!) and luckily for me- literally 4 miles from my parents' home in Beavercreek. There is ample parking in the lots as we'll as metered parking along the sides of the businesses. Because it is the most moderately priced ""nice"" restaurant in the area, I've been told the wait time at Cheesecake Factory can be anywhere between 15-30 min. Lucky for me, the longest I've waited at this establishment was only ever ~10 min. Moving on, service at the Cheesecake Factory at The Greene has always been above average. My servers never go above and beyond (servers in Connecticut offer wine/alcoholic choices with my meals), but they've never slighted or ignored my table... It's really whatever. The same can be said about the food. It tastes like every other Cheesecake Factory in the country (CA, OH, MA, NY, etc). Mind you, I find that to be a good thing- I always like to try new things on the menu, but am glad to have sure-fire dishes to fall back to.

Crab cake bites were the most popular at our table. Light and fluffy texture but still creamy on the inside. Could use a little more crab meat, but those are ""crab"" cakes for you. The Vietnamese sandwiches are banh mi inspired. The dish comes as three small bao sandwiches but are pretty filling.

Debbe T.,"Dayton, OH",55,139,20,5.0,2/22/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that stays consistent so you are never really disappointed but I have never considered it extraordinary either.  However, this last time I decided to try their Skinny menu.  Honestly,I was expecting something that would be lacking in taste, but I was so surprised.  I started with the Skinny Cosmo, and it tasted better than most regular Cosmos I have had elsewhere, and they did not scrimp on the alcohol either.  I chose the Skinny chicken enchiladas.  The chicken was grilled to perfection and the sauce had just enough spiciness and amazing flavor.  It was served with a side of cold vegetables, cauliflower, carrots and some other things I don't recall.   My husband had the soup and salad combo.  The soup was cream of potato and the the salad had a Greek flair with feta cheese.   He was pleased with his selections. We topped the meal off with of course a slice of cheesecake that we shared.  We had the dolce de leche.  It was very light and delicious.  I could have almost finished the whole thing by myself.  We also had a cup of coffee.  This is one of the few places that serves something other than a mild/medium brew.  It tasted like it was French Roast.  So if you are not a fan of dark roast coffee you might want to skip the coffee.  But for me, I was delighted.  The darker and stronger the better. For some reason, the place was really crowded and it took a little longer than usual to get our food.  I'm attributing this to the weather.  This was one of the first days over a weekend where the temps were Spring-like.  After the winter we have been having I am guess everyone was suffering from cabin fever and needed to get out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=60

An appetizer with two dinners and deserts will add up very very quickly so be mindful of that. I have never been disappointed with the food and the wait staff always seems to do an ok job.  This is a nice place for a different dinner when you have some extra money to spend. The cheesecake is the only real reason I come here though. Also,  their menu is way to large. They really need to cut it down to ensure quality stays high.

Everyone enjoyed the food and was able to take enough home to have for the next day.. We managed to get out pretty cheap, for under $200 for the 6 of each, each drinking more than enough..

I didn't taste any miso!!!  Not sure why the salmon taste more sugar on it than the saltiness of miso.... I didn't taste any miso what-so-ever!  One HUGE disappointment for sure.  I know I shouldn't be so picky with the chain restaurant like this, but if I'm spending average $17-$20 a plate for dinner, I expect a bit more than what we had tonight.  So only one out of three dishes are good, that's why I decided to just give it 2 stars this time.  If I ever make it back there, we'll see if it gets better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=60

My partner and I ordered the salmon carpaccio, Vietnamese Tacos, and Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll, Spicy shrimp and our friend ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Salmon carpaccio was  served  with dinner plate sized sliver of salmon,  red onion, avocado and spicy mayo. Tasty but too many mushy elements together.  The appetizer of 3 Vietnamese Tacos was supposed to be a sticky bun with pulled pork (akin to bahn mi). The bread (DRY) was similar to white bread, also the pork was dry. I could keep going on...

Aaron H.,"Lebanon, OH",4,76,8,2.0,1/10/2016,"I'm not opposed to paying for a top quality meal; however, I've been disappointed in every Cheesecake Factory visit to date. I will admit, the Beavercreek location was quite a bit better than the other three visits to Kenwood. This time, the service was fantastic, the meal was average, and the price tag was exorbitant. My wife was pleased with her Pasta Carbonara. It was served piping hot, and the waitress provided fresh shredded Parmesan with no prompting. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, and the plate it was served on was warmer than the pasta itself. I sent it back, and the manager brought the refire, correctly apologizing, and asking if it was satisfactory (which it was). My wife and I ordered coffee and cheesecake afterwards, and were pleased with our selections. A shame really, because the front of the house is very clean, very upscale, and the servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and spot on. The kitchen may have just mis-timed my meal, and the manager did make it right, but with so many restaurants to choose from, I think I'll spend my money elsewhere.

Kristie S.,"Downtown, Cincinnati, OH",6,19,5,2.0,8/1/2012,"Let me preface this review by saying, we were going out with a large group (16 people).  Sometimes you have to go where the group wants to go. We got there at 7 and had a 7 o'clock reservation.  The hostess said she could not seat us until half of our group arrived.  Luckily they walked in the door right after us because we have a 2 month old and we needed a place to sit to feed him.  Once we had half the group the hostess told us that they only had room for 14 of our 16.  We could wait until there was room for the other two or we could sit down and when the other table finished their desert we'd have room for all 16.  We opted to go ahead and sit, but I never noticed any issues with the number of seats at the table. The restaurant is loud, but that's a good thing when you have several kids under 10 in your group. I ordered the eggplant sandwich and subbed in sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.  The eggplant sandwich was not good.  Eggplant can be iffy and this eggplant was tough.  It was more of a fork and knife eggplant than a sandwich eggplant. I took a couple bites of the cheesecake.  That was good, three of us tackled a single slice.   Our server did a great job of managing our large group.  Refills were timely and our orders all came out right even though we seemed to be playing musical chairs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=100

Mike G.,"Denver, CO",22,108,7,1.0,6/28/2008,"I have ben to this Cheesecake Factory 3 times now... 2 out of 3 have been pretty poor experiences, and my most recent trip was bad enough to A) talk to the manager about it, and B) Decide never to go there again... We had 5 of us in our group, and were coming from the bar already with drinks.  Our waitress was prompt in coming over and chatting with us, but took 10 minutes to get water out to us.. Not a huge deal, but it was a sign of things to come.. Apps came out quick and were pretty decent (calimari and some king of spring roll things).  Then the wait began.  About 30-40 minutes after ordering, 2 entrees came out.  About 10-12 minutes after that, 2 more came out.  This led to 4 of us having food in front of us getting cold, and 1 unlucky diner in our group not having anything.  I should mention now that our waitress has stopped by 4 or 5 times without clearing the appetizer plates (empty) or asking to get us another round of drinks.   We ask for more drinks, 3 beers that are on tap, and we wait.  We wait for our last entree to come out.. We wait for beers... The beers took over 10 minutes.  We could have walked to the bar to get them in shorter time, hell, we could have walked across the street to the pub and got them shorter.   Finally, well over an hour since sitting down, our last entree arrives.. This is a solid 20 minutes after the first persons food came out.   The food wasn't to thrilling. I think some of it could have been better if it had not been sitting for 20 minutes (while politely waiting for everyones food to arrive).. But some of it was just flat-out bland.  Nothing anyone said was great, and the hibachi steak (the one we waited on) was bad enough only to have a few bites and call it quits. I asked to speak to the manager, which I rarely do.. He came over and we explained what had happened.  He checked the ticket times of the food and bar and told us nothing took more than 4 minutes to come out from the bar, and that our server forgot to put in someones entree, thus it had to be remade.  I suggested that no ones food should have come out early or late, creating the 30 minute parade of entree-at-a-time.  He tended to agree with all our issues, and made some excuses about being new there and some staff changes.  He offered us free dessert (which we declined, we'd already been in the place 2.5hrs), and then took about 15 minutes to get the checks to us. 2 out of 3 times at this Cheesecake Factory = never again... I would probably give it another try if the manager was more understanding and did not make excuses.  But, he didn't.

We felt like cattle. After a 50 minute wait, luckily we were a party of two or it would've been much longer, we were rounded into our tiny booth. We enjoyed a basket of complimentary bread (no silverware so we had to dip our bread into the butter packets like heathens.) After looking through their 79 page menu I decided on their herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi. The salmon was very tiny and no way crusted in herbs. Tasty but small. The shrimp scampi was also pretty good but only consisted of 3 shrimp. My girlfriend got an Asian chicken salad or something to that effect and the Asian plum dressing was the best thing on our table. Pretty solid. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that their mashed potatoes that came with my meal was a 5lb mass of sheer density. Could've been used as spackle. As I sit here belching and farting from tonight's meal I promise I'll never step foot inside this place again. I don't get the appeal.

Two of us ordered off of that menu, and we enjoyed our entrees.  All of our food was fresh, well prepared, and tasted good.  The service was not speedy, but not ridiculously slow, either. This is a good place for a leisurely Sunday brunch. We were offered refills on iced tea, but never on coffee (?). Our server was pleasant and reasonably efficient.

It tasted good but skimpy on the chicken. We also ordered the Artichoke crisps...they were edible, very greasy though and ailoi was not very flavorful.  My husband ordered the Thai Chicken pasta and it had hardly any sauce. My father got the pasta with meat sauce and my Mom got the burrito. They enjoyed their food.   My meal (the most expensive at $19.99) was the worst. I ordered the shrimp scampi/Steak Diane combo.  Most of the plate was filled with mashed potato's....I am talking more than 4 servings worth although tasty. It came with 3 medium shrimp and the scampi cream sauce was good. BUT, the steak Diane was awful.  The wine sauce tasted like water sauce. I complained to the waiter who brought out MORE sauce which was a little more wine tasting but had a large layer of oil sitting on top.  On the plus side, we were seated nearly immediately.....we use to have to wait up to 1-2 hours......maybe that should have been a warning.  Oh, my Peach Bellini was very good and I would order it again.  Next time I go, I will just get a couple of Peach Bellini's and cheesecake.  ~review by Mrs. Gary~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-beavercreek?start=100

Why is it, that after waiting patiently for an hour, that my repeated inquiries were uniformly answered with the same canned, ""you are the next table to be seated"" response? You start to wonder when your party of seven is seated after the party of ten, who has waited half the time. You'd think that after the manager intervenes you'd get more than a condescending, ""you should have said something sooner"" and a chair thrown onto the end of a six person table.
