Jackie H.,"Seattle, WA",469,350,201,3.0,1/12/2009,"During college this place was always packed and for good reasons. It is right in front of Meridian Mall and near Meijer. What place can you go to for inexpensive lunch or dinner with just one person or a large group? It's got a large variety of things to choose from and lots in the drink department.  It's not stellar but it's not horrible, that's why it gets 3 stars from me. I never had bad service here and was seated within 15-30 minutes at most. Now of course if you come during prime eating hours then yes, you will wait. It's in a college town near lots of shopping and has a wide variety of food to satisfy many different appetites.  My fiance loves Chilis and he always got the chili here and loved it. The hamburgers were always yummy and the strawberry lemonade was my favorite. They have great appetizers and other dishes as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8?start=20
Ruben L.,"Canton, MI",179,532,7,2.0,7/22/2008,"2.5- this place really is average Chilli's- you and I have had a love hate relationship.  How I loved your: - mombo combo (or triple play, whatever the heck you call it) - country fried steak (not the best, but certainly filling) - free meals after you gave us such bad service - countless meals with friends spent here - your mugs that I stole 6 of and used all throughout college - 1 lb of fajitas on Mondays for $15 - proximity to the mall - restaurant before I moved to a city that actually had choices With the good came the bad- -crappy service because I was ""just"" a teenager -underwhelming quality of food at times -45 minute waits (you're chilli's, C'MON!) -sticky tables not properly wiped down -you were considered ""fine dining"" back in High school -running out of certain foods I have been to this Chilli's far more than I can count.  I haven't been back since 2000, and doubt I ever will.  But for the hometown people, this isn't the worst in the area, but it's certainly not the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8?start=20
Matt R.,"East Lansing, MI",82,222,17,4.0,7/22/2008,"Are U kidding? I am the frist to review friggin Chili's? I know ya'll have been there. Here is the lowdown: They score high on atmosphere, cold beer, the best, best chips & queso dip and mostly good appetizers. They falter with their main dishes. The whole southwest thing can just go too far. Chipotle Grouper Fingers..anyone? Black Bean and Corn Jumbo Dog with Mango Salsa? No takers? Well, I just go there to sit in the bar (duh) and drink the cold beer, good chips and watch their large TV's. If that is what you seek (and you would be wise to seek it) than this is your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8?start=20
Alicia P.,"Okemos, Meridian charter Township, MI",19,1,,5.0,9/26/2017,"When we are out in that area, my husband and I have recently begun stopping in for a big lunch or early dinner. Their steaks are AWESOME, as are the loaded mashed potatoes and blackberry iced tea! Very few restaurants can consistently get a steak done PERFECTLY and yet Chili's does! Chili's steaks and servers are every bit as good (actually much better) than the Roadhouses! We were there on 9/25/17 for lunch and Rob was our server! He should be responsible for training all servers everywhere!! He was fun, energetic, helpful and knowledgeable about everything. He didn't hover but didn't ignore us either. Many servers (at other comparable places) are one extreme or the other. Rob was perfect!  Without hesitation I highly recommend this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Tammy D.,"Perry, MI",8,8,4,5.0,12/30/2017,Excellent service and food! Our waitress Julie went above and beyond and even interacted with our kids by far the best experience we have had at any restaurant! Julie is the best and we will definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Danielle T.,"Fort Worth, TX",139,245,310,4.0,10/18/2017,"Okemos is where it's at for chain restaurants. This chilis is one of the better chilis I've been too, the service was actually good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Randy A.,"Lansing, MI",0,58,3,4.0,7/22/2017,"This was my first time at chili's, Comfy atmosphere, I was by myself..so I sat in the bar. Was promptly greeted and had my beverage..I ordered the chicken fajitas.. Used the wifi while waiting for my food..great wifi by the way...the dish came out sizzilling,, and smelling great...grilled chicken and onions and peppers...and guac and sour cream and salsa and black beans on the side...tasted terrific..I prefer more spices...but a really good meal..Service waz good too. I like the little kiosk at the table..no waiting for my check..touch the screen and swipe your card and boom..your ready to go. I would recommend this place..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Doug M.,"Lansing, MI",0,11,,3.0,8/16/2017,"Went there yesterday with a friend for lunch. He had a turkey sandwich and I had a BBQ chicken/ribs combo. The food was acceptable, the service was outstanding. The chicken (half breast with bone and skin) was tasty and juicy. My only complaint was that the skin was flabby and the fat not rendered off. Fries, corn and garlic bread were all acceptable. My friend said his turkey sandwich was pretty good. Probably the biggest complaint was with the ribs. They tasted okay, but scrawny with very little meat. I went there with a gift card and since I have another gift card I will likely go back. Overall, it was standard fare, pretty typical of sit-down casual chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Tracy R.,"Laingsburg, MI",8,10,,5.0,5/31/2017,"Great food.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich with fries, made hot and fresh.   The service was fast and professional.  As this was my first visit to Chili's, this experience was A+ in my book.  I will definately come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Shelee B.,"Okemos, MI",11,4,,3.0,9/11/2017,"Walked in on a Sunday afternoon, restaurant was essentially empty. Asked for a booth and the main area was filthy where we were seated. Three large tables had stacks of dirty dishes and no one seemed eager to clear them. Totally unappetizing so we asked to be reseated in the bar. Noticed the floor was also dirty with napkins and smashed food which no one was cleaning up. Ordered the traditional nachos and got the stuffed nachos instead. Husband ordered a large beer and got a small one. Finally the Oreo dessert had no crushed Oreos on it. The only thing that saved the experience was that the food tasted good, but not good enough to eat in a dirty restaurant. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Katherine R.,"Fairfax, VT",4,50,32,4.0,7/10/2017,"The service was fast. The food was delicious. I am new to the area so I was shocked I actually walked inside. The Chili's back home are crappy. Their menu seems the same. My waiter was nice. I had a dirty knife, which she promptly took care of. Overall good. 4 stars is a good rating for them. Just wasn't a 5star place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Laurie P.,"Haslett, MI",9,12,12,3.0,9/30/2016,"With the new remodel we were hoping it was going to improve.  We should have known better.  No coasters for the drinks, smaller portions and only mediocre at best.  The remodel looks nice but the food is still only ok.  Time to frequent somewhere else",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Terri B.,"DeWitt, MI",5,1,,1.0,9/2/2016,"Plate was so hot it left me blistered and in tears.  I am a working woman and have plenty of tough skin on my hands.  Manager took an accident report but failed to comp the meal I could not touch, let alone eat. Bad example of a $15 meal.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Elizabeth D.,"Reno, NV",26,203,89,1.0,8/3/2014,"It was not a good decision to come here on a whim because I was in the area, hungry and craving ribs. Let me start with the good. The manager on duty was very nice and walked around asking all the customers if everything was okay. Our waitress was attentive, although she didn't seem to enjoy her job very much. The bad--the food here is just awful and overpriced. I don't think it's the Chili's chain necessarily as I've had decent food at other Chili's. The french fries were crispy but tasted as if they'd been fried in old oil. Same with the pretzel appetizers. The ribs, the boneless buffalo wings... it all just tasted old and stale. The dessert and drink menu on the table was sticky and dirty. You're better off eating at the food court in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Jessica A.,"East Lansing, MI",0,43,11,1.0,11/5/2016,"Visited Chile's in Okemos, MI for lunch today. Bad experience! We haven't eaten at a Chile's in 7 years!!! Last time, we ate at Chile's in Laughlin, NV and we had food poisoning for 3 days. Thus haven't eaten at one since, until today! We sat in the bar at a table and were not greeted for 5 minutes. We ordered cheese fries, not very good & our child's food immediately; both took a while. We ordered two burgers and a kids cheese burger. My daughters arrived with no cheese on it; had to send it back. My burger was cooked well, not medium. The meat tasted horrible! Got the bill with $1.99 charge for entertainment because our daughter played on the iPad; we didn't even know there was a charge to use it until the bill came! Server removed charge. That's horrible! Chile's kids press. Uttons; it's what they do! We didn't even know there was a charge until the bill came!!! So we  an app, 3 burgers, 3 drinks & tip =$73!! Horrible!! Waste of $$$!! Over priced, horrible experience!! Chile's will be lucky if we try you again in 7 more years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Miriam V.,"Okemos, MI",1,15,,3.0,3/5/2016,"Had lunch at Chili's. Sat in lounge area. Ordered soup and salad, daughter ordered soup and queso dip. Added on wings. Mistake. Not a fan.

CeCe S.,"Livonia, MI",283,10,1,5.0,10/30/2015,"Yummy food I love the chicken enchiladas with the sour cream sauce ! So good . Our waitress was awesome! I wish I remembered her name. She was a younger woman. Made jokes with us, served us efficient and was awesome ! Would definitely come back and hope for the same waitress !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
LJ M.,"East Lansing, MI",3,52,12,2.0,1/13/2015,"We ordered Chili's to Go last night for the first time in months hoping it would be better than the last attempt. We were wrong and very disappointed. Fajitas were cold, with very little steak strips and stale tasting tortillas. Thankfully, we had some shells at home. All I wanted was a bacon burger. It was supposed to come with bacon, ranch sauce, sauteed onions and pickles. First of all, there was no ranch but a tiny bit of what I think was mayo and one small, burnt piece of bacon. The burger was way over cooked and black on one side. Onions were so small I couldn't taste them. Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the chicken tortilla soup was good. Overpriced, but good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Nick M.,"Highland Park, IL",56,17,1,1.0,6/29/2013,"My family was looking for a last minute dinner idea for Saturday night and because we were already at the local mall, decided to try Chili's for the first time.  What a disappointment experience.   After being seated, my mother and myself ordered gin and tonics to start our meal.  For the first time in my life I actually had a my drink order refused because the bar at the restaurant was out of tonic.  A full bar on Saturday night, out of tonic, how is that possible? So we skipped the drinks and ordered our meal.  Another disappointment experience.  First, the order took forever and the staff during this delay, never came back to check on us nor look to refill our water or my kids soft drinks.  When the food did come it was less than appetizing.  My daughter's hamburger was way over cooked with the edges hard and burnt.  My salad was horrible.  I ordered the Caribbean salad with chicken.  The supposed fresh fruit was mealy and not sweet.  The dried cranberry's were stale and old. The only time the staff was attentive is when we asked for the bill. Nothing about this experience would have us return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Brandon S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2051,1184,54,2.0,1/1/2010,"We stopped into Chili's on our way to a New Year's Eve party. All of the local non-chain joints closed early or did not open at all for the day. While it is a chain you can usually get a decent meal.  It was not too busy. We walked in and sat down right away at a table in the bar area. The service from then on was extremely slow. It took far too long for our waitress to come up to us at all, and there was far too much time between visits.  I ordered a smokehouse burger medium. What came to the table was a bacon cheeseburger well done. I pointed this out to the waitress. She apologized and took it away. Within a few minutes she came back with the ""correct"" burger.  This was the same burger, now with the correct toppings. At this point i gave up and ate.  My biggest complaint is that i never received a drink refill. This is a huge pet peeve for me. My drink should never go dry for any amount of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Richard B.,"Mason, MI",0,13,4,2.0,4/14/2014,"I have always enjoyed going to chilli's for their great service, atmosphere, and best of all, the food. This all changed when I moved out to Okemos.  I have been to the Okemos chilli's a hand full of times only to walk out disappointed. I'm always telling myself ""The next time will be better"" but unfortunately this is not the case.  Every time I have been to the Chilli's in Okemos, there is always something wrong with either the service or the food. There has been times where we were seated and didn't see the server for 15 minutes. The last time we went to the chilli's in Okemos, the service was great but the food was TERRIBLE! I ordered a burger that was dripping with grease, bland, and I got sick from it later that night. My wife ordered a steak that was seared in a pan for a few seconds, then served. She cut into the steak and noticed it was raw! She took a little nibble of the steak because she was hungry and the steak was bland. My mother in law could not finish her chicken because it was too spicy hot. Her chicken was not even suppose to be spicy?? I bought my daughter a kids meal and it tasted like freezer burnt crap. We had a table of 12 that night and all I heard was everyone complaining.. We normally don't complain but this was suppose to be an enjoyable experience.   I would not recommend this chilli's to anyone until the chief and management is replaced. Hope this helps anyone out there....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
Monica C.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,2,,1.0,9/7/2014,"My family dined here recently. The host attempted to seat us at a table with leftover chunks of food on the table and floor. I thought this may have been a genuine mistake, but the entire section of tables was in the same state. The host attempted to blame this obvious oversight on kids?? The food was average. Service was extremely slow. However, the deal breaker was when my husband observed the cook leave the men's bathroom without washing his hands and return to the kitchen!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-okemos-8
