103,Nicole C.,"Chandler, AZ",36,58,22.0,4.0,2012-02-25,I love this place when I am looking for something more than just a fast food burger. My personal favorite is the Blue Ribbon Burger its so tasty. It has just the right amount of bleu cheese an steak sauce topped off with crispy onion strings and don't forget to try the parmesan garlic fries with your burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=120,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
57,Monica O.,"Tempe, AZ",885,948,3098.0,4.0,2012-03-14,"Was wanting a burger, but didn't want to cook dinner so I asked my daughter & son if they would like to go get some food, they picked Red Robin, we haven't been to a Red Robin since we have lived here so I was ok let's go try it.   The kids don't get the whole eating at non chain restaurants, there is still some push back and well this time I wanted a burger so it was cool I ordered the Banzai Burger, I just love teriyaki burgers, the grilled pineapple and cheese with lettuce and mayo and for s&g's I toss in some thousand island dressing and it becomes this burger bliss!!  Now I like my burger well done, I'm not into the pink showing, but the burger I ordered was pink, told our server and he took the burger and got me a nicely done one! And it was delish baby!!  Michael our server was great and attentive; making sure everyone had everything they needed. The manager even took my burger off the check, which I didn't except because I was happy with my order after it was corrected.  It's always great to have good service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=40,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576

76,Chris S.,"Tempe, AZ",298,569,1415.0,2.0,2012-06-13,"I don't know what went wrong with this place. The many times we have been here before the service was great now it has slowly gone downhill. One waitress we had a few occasions ago was excellent. She was friendly, took our order in a reasonable time, brought us sauces in adequate amounts (I hate it when they give you a dinky portion that you know you're just going to end up asking for more soon), we never needed to flag anyone down and she came over frequently but not too frequently to see if we were doing okay. The last few times were terrible. I think this is either the result of inadequate management or disorganization by everyone. Possibly both, okay I must watch too many Kitchen Nightmares or something. One time we were seated to the right of the restaurant when you come in, by the bar area. A girl came and took our drink orders, myself partaking in an endless root beer float (only a little over $3 I might add) and my partner ordering a margarita. Some time passed (10 min) and then we had to flag someone down to get them to bring us our drinks. Margarita was disappointingly small for the price but root beer float was fabulous as usual, they forgot the spoon which also had to be flagged down for. Ordering time comes which was during the span of time waiting for drinks and so forth. Food takes awhile to come out, meanwhile the waitress is serving as the bartender for the whole restaurant making drinks one after another while waiters whiz by in and out carrying drink orders and we are left wondering when can we get a refill and where is our food? Food finally comes and someone else brings it and we discover my partner's food is cold. Sent it back and it comes back better but the whole experience was aggravating, no set server for a table and to keep flagging down people for things. It was like the equivalent to being seated next to the bathroom or kitchen, forgetful service and confusing, crowded and busy servers rushing by. The next time we came they tried to sit us there again! We replied with a resounding NO and the girl looked very ""butthurt"" for lack of a more flavorful word. We explained why but she didn't seem to be too concerned. We sadly looked at the people who were sitting in that area, aware of the service they were about to receive. Finally we ended up where we wanted to sit and the server was just okay, not very friendly. I hate it when I look at other tables in a restaurant and I see their servers are way more friendlier than mine and then I end up having ""server envy.""  Summary: weekends are very crowded, if you are only two people they might try to stick you in the ""forgetmenot"" area. Families and larger groups they seem to move to the main dining area as I noted. I think I'm just going to find another location. Although I dislike chains mostly, Red Robin is a decent place to grab a burger $8-11 and don't forget those bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=60,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

Ten mins went by and no server to be seen walking by much less approaching any table down the aisle.  Ten mins was enough wasted time, so I left and walked across the street to a much friendlier restaurant with real service. Update: 11-21-13 I went back today for a late lunch, of course very few people in the restaurant and service was what one would hope and expect. Why isn't it great service all the time. Many of my friends that I told about the very poor initial service ALL stated to a person that their service us simply MISERABLE but they do like their burgers.  Food today was OK, not enough for me to return for future poor service during busy times.

We stopped by for lunch today and got the same friendly service I always get. I ordered the grilled chicken salad over fresh greens with a honey mustard dressing.

I asked our server for a wash cloth to wipe it again but they never brought one. I also watched a bus boy wipe a table next to us without any cleaning products.

Which include a coke, beer, and chocolate milk.  The pregnant hostess couldn't have been more rude, after I thanked her twice for seating us.

Update on 10/7/14: About a week ago, the manager got in touch with me and apologized for the bad service, and offered to hear our complaints and send us a gift card.

All they ended up doing was increasing prices and lowering food quality and consistency. Now this location has decided to remodel as a desperate step to become ""hip and cool."" The service has been horrible the last few times we have been here. Inexperienced and rude waiters and slow service.

The other evening my fiancé and I came in for dinner, and surprisingly it wasn't packed like we expected. Our waitress was absolutely terrible. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what, but she took forever to bring us our drinks, forgot to bring us plates for our appetizers (even reminded herself and still forgot), checked on us maybe ONCE the entire time.... just awful. She was catering to other customers (we assume), but she would completely walk past our table every time we saw her. A younger boy who I guess helps bring out the food was more prompt than her. He brought us extra fries, napkins, even checked on us to see how we were doing! We ended up tipping him and just left her a few dollars. I understand if you're having a bad night, you may be off your game, but holy shit at least come by and let us know you're busy, if that's even the case. Oh and another thing- the manager took his time going to every table to ask how their meal was, except for us. Is it because we are a younger couple? Honestly I have noticed since we are in our late 20's, we receive shit service. Regardless of age, we are respectful, easy going, tip generously, but I guess that's not enough.

Keep in mind there was not a line nor was it busy. They didn't even bother to look at us and they weren't professional. I had to literally say loudly, WE NEED A BOOTH NOT A BAR TABLE. Our server was slow and awkward. When we asked for our ticket and dessert it took the server 20 minutes and we didn't even get our dessert for which we were charged for. We wanted to leave and so we went up to register and asked another employee to ring us out. She was the most rude person in that place. She told us: ""Well, your server has to take care of that"" and they left us dangling there for 10 minutes. The woman at the register would not help us but kept adding her 2 cents in. They did remove the charge for dessert we did not get, and the manager didn't even bother to see us. This is by far one of most terrible places I have been to and I will not come back.  So, my rate for this Red Robin is 2 out of 10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=120,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.052,2.56

It was supposed to have sun dried tomatoes, arugula , and a mayo based  sauce that  made the burger and bun SWIM in grease I wish I was kidding , or even exaggerating!! I tried twice to pick it up and had grease running down my hands ..

I left hungry and pissed off . My time and my money were both wasted at this place . I would love to know what the crowds of people were ordering ?!?!?

I had the peppercorn burger, the wife had a chicken salad.  The chicken was odd.  Unexpected texture.  They took care of it in a timely fashion.  My burger was pretty good.  Really probably 3.5 stars, but for a burger place they are pretty consistent and good.  So I don't want to round down.

They took an entree off of our tab, but left the other three customers with us paying for food we expressed our displeasure with.

The manager Dave came over and was very dismissive and rude. He said he would come back to check on us to make sure everything was resolved and never came back. To top everything off we get our bill with two burgers we didn't order on it and two kids meals. There was no apology or comp for ruining our evening or messing up all our food, instead a check for 30 dollars more than it should of been for.

Must have waited 10-15 minutes for a host: even though waiters passed the area frequently. Took another 10 minutes before I was seated; despite plenty of seating. Other times I have encountered several groups of people at the door waiting for a host. Instead if taking down info of other groups, the host walks away to check what seating is available. The host then sets the table and comes back to seat the party. This took about 5-10minutes to look and set up another 10 minutes to seat and return to the front. Other waiting guests have to stand in a crowded door way.  This last time there were four groups waiting. Host wasn't around. I asked how long people had been waiting. ""Forever"" was the answer. People were asking the obvious question why is there only one person during dinner, and where is the manager? Every incident there was only one host during peak meal time. Other staff running around but no one helps. Where's the GM?  More people arrive,  but me and another group left. It concerns me when staff is cut down.

Growing up in Seattle, where the first Red Robin was opened, I grew up going to this place. I moved down to Arizona about 15 years ago, and I started visiting the Red Robins down here. I loved every minute; there was a perfect combination of bottomless steak fries and a unique atmosphere. But the last few years the quality of service has declined exponentially. The most recent time I went, something was different. Red Robin decided to install these bullshit ""Ziosk"" tablets on each and every table. What ever happened to enjoying small talk and interacting with other human beings? Even in the last 5 years with the introduction of the smartphone our social patterns have been warped. With the installation of these devices you no longer have to talk to the server. It's disappointing to see such a wonderful place of gathering spoiled by technology.

There really wasn't a whole lot of room to seat 6 dudes and 1 girl (me) comfortably. (We also gained 1 more further into our stay, which made it more squished) There looked to be tables that could have been put together with a long booth on one side. We would have waited a few more minutes to have been seated comfortably. That is why I am taking a star off. Accurately place your patrons, please. Also some of the locks on the stalls in the bathroom are pretty janky and can be pulled open while it's locked. I think it was the handicap stall, might want to check that out. Our waitress was awesome. She handled the crazyness of us with ease. I'm sure she was pleased when we left but she never showed it (; I forget her name, I want to say it started with a K, younger blonde.  She brought plenty of refills for the dudes without anyone asking. And for ONCE in my life at a RR location (I frequent RR a lot) my BLT has REAL and MULTIPLE strips of bacon on it!! I didn't have to ASK for real bacon strips. For a 14+$ sandwich I should not be recieving bacon crumbles that are gone within two bites of the sandwich. Kudos to the kitchen. Great job waitress for being very attentive to us and our needs and for putting up with my 'unique' group. Ha ha.

I think our visit was predestined when we first walked up to the front doors. C held open the door for a group of 5 as they were leaving. NONE of them said ""Thank You"". Seriously? Get some manners &%$holes. When someone holds a door open for you whether you're coming or going, acknowledge them. Geez, my 10 year old has better manners than most adults.  Anywhoos, as I said, that should have told us how our night would go. After the human turds left, we went up to the host stand and waited. Hmmm, I'm sure someone will help us soon I told C. It wasn't that long, maybe a minute or 2 but eventually a hostess came up, grabbed some menus and walked us to our table. We sat and then waited for our server. And wait we did. After 10 minutes (I start the timer on my phone as soon as we're sat) I told C we would give them another minute before leaving. C suggested that we just move to another table because he really wanted a RR burger and reminded me that I had my birthday coupon. Alright, we gave our server another minute to show up, they didn't, so I walked back over to the host stand and asked to be re-sat. The same hostess apologized and took us to another section. Now we've been there 15 minutes and are finally getting started.  Our second server was Sydney. Awesome. She apologized for the issue and took our drink orders. NOTE: If you're ordering your kid one of the fancy lemonades, make sure they bring the kid version. We've been charged over $4 for C to get a ""Poppin Lemonade"" in the past but this time, it was $1.19. Just saying... So C got his Poppin Purple lemonade ($1.19) which came with a free refill this time. We had to pay for the refill last time. Interesting. C also ordered the Little Red's Burger with Fries ($4.99). The burger was cooked properly, Medium, and the fries as well. C had also ordered a side of pickles, as he always does and Sydney hooked him up. 16 pickles in a little ramekin. C was a happy camper. I ordered the Peppercorn Burger ($10.99), sauce on the side with endless Broccoli. The patty was cooked a perfect medium rare and was seasoned correctly. This was a tasty burger. The issue came with the Broccoli. Both times, the original and refill, were undercooked. Not by a little, by a lot. Hard, basically raw broccoli just isn't complimentary to the meal. Bummer. Sydney brought out the Birthday Sundae for C and I to share. Some average vanilla ice cream with fudge on top but it was a nice way to finish the meal.  Crappy first 15 minutes of service, good kids burger, good peppercorn burger, good fries, lousy broccoli, great service from Sydney Po. 3.5 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,3.404,2.44

1,Amy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,58,19.0,1.0,2016-09-09,"We visited Red Robin on Chandler Blvd. by Chandler Mall tonight. We ordered our food about 10 minutes after 8pm. It was just my husband and I. We contemplated getting up and leaving because we noticed how filthy dirty the restaurant was. Bathrooms had trash all over, the restaurant floors were so dirty - used napkins on the floor and tons of food all over the floor, and right next to me, some white smeared something on the booth that I didn't see when we were seated. (See pic). Many tables went in-bussed the entire visit. However since we were very hungry we figured we would eat quick and go and try not to touch anything. Bad choice!  Both of our meals came out incorrect and nothing was done to rectify mine. I took 1 single bite and realized that even though I asked for no mayonnaise it had it anyway. My husband asked for a side salad instead of fries - he got fries. A person (manager I believe) brought the side salad out right away. Our server Justin took my chicken sandwich back and it took long enough for my husband to eat his entire meal - fish and chips and salad. I finally asked for my replacement meal to go because we couldn't wait any longer. I left having not eaten but the one bite and some fries.  I have to say I was disappointed that not even a simple apology from our server or a manager was given. And that I paid for my meal that I didn't get to enjoy. Nothing was done to rectify the situation for a meal I didn't even get to eat. Unfortunately we left a $0 tip. I felt bad but why should I have left feeling bad? My guess or hope was that they were understaffed hence the slow service and dirty tables and floors.  In all, we were there for about an hour and 10 minutes. I won't return to that location again. I'm a Red Robin Loyalty Rewards member so I usually enjoy it but tonight it was anything but enjoyable.

My first visit there back in December with out of town guests (grandkids in tow) was a very expensive and unsatisfactory experience.  Not much was correct or edible about our $160 dinner.  Fast forward to today. My guests were another grandchild and my daughter. It started off sketchy when we ordered our drinks which consisted of a lemonade, an iced tea and a chocolate milk. The lemonade was watered down, which indicates they need to refill the syrup, and the iced tea tasted like burned rubber or plastic. After letting our server know, and not getting so much as an apology, my daughter ordered a coke and I requested a hot tea and a glass of ice.  Next, was our meal... my daughter wasn't asked until after we were completely done with our meal if she'd like more fries, and my avoCobbo salad was missing the avocado, and the chicken was charred and dry. I told the server about the avocado and she delivered 3 skinny avocado pieces, again, without so much as an apology. The tomatoes in the salad appeared to have been diced a few days ago since they were mushy and not the right color. The table was never cleared of the iced tea and lemonade that we had replaced. And the food overall was again below mediocre.  As much as I have enjoyed Red Robins in the past 30 years, I will never again attempt to give this one another chance.

After pulling most of them off, the burger was delicious! Come on cooks...get it right...not so hard to tell the difference in GRILLED onions and onion STRAWS! Next time I would ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side tho...not enough on it for my liking. (I consider that my fault so no minus stars!)      The fries were IN A CUP?? The burger in a nice container where it stayed hot, but the fries were in a cup in the bag and were cold by the time they were delivered. Really? In a cup on the side? PLENTY of room in that big plastic container with the burger!  I was happy they added a side packet of seasoning for the fries tho! One Star Bonus!      I specifically asked for NO ONION or tomato on the artichoke dip. ... HM... SURPRISE! Lots of little onions peeking at me when I opened the dip at dinner! Should have known after the cooks not knowing the difference of onion straws vs grilled onions they wouldn't know what NO ONIONS on the dip would mean either.        The small container was only HALF FULL of dip and after picking all the little pieces of onion off, less than half was left.  I only needed 5 of the 20 chips they included to eat the small portion of dip but at least they were fresh and salted.       5 stars for grubhub delivery but 2 stars (generous) for Red Robin. The burger was good but it looks like I am in the majority with yelpers here.... if they could get the order right, the food is really good!

28,Eddie K.,"Chandler, AZ",3,52,48.0,4.0,2017-10-07,"Came here for my free birthday burger! Free food is always great. Was greeted right as i walked in. I took a seat in the lounge/bar area as it was relatively empty. My server came within a few minutes to take my drink order and food order. I orders the California Chicken with bottomless fries. Asked for an order of fries to start of with and it took about 5 mins to come out, fries came out hot and fresh. Food came out shortly after, less than 10 minutes since ordering. As I took my first bite, I noticed there was no guacamole. I told my server and she brought me a side no questions asked. The sandwich was good.

22,Gillian C.,"Gilbert, AZ",92,108,285.0,4.0,2017-10-22,"We came here for lunch.  We were quickly seated in the lounge.  Nice atmosphere.   Friendly staff-quick to refill drinks- Also no waiting.  It was a great seat, not too loud and there was a good hame to watch. I ordered my burger with added  bleu cheese, red onions (in addition to onion straws that came on it), and sauce on the side.  They forgot the onion straws. Easily fixed-they brought some out on a plate w/apoligies. Everything else was correct about my burger. The burger was cooked correctly but when it came out, I could tell it had been sitting for a bit.  It was luke-warm....not piping hot.  The onion fries they brought out weren't ""hot"" (temp) either.  I also ordeted a side of pickles (after-the-fact) and they were luke warm.  Pickles should have been cold like the red onions and tomatoes, lol.  Never-the-less, It was a very tasty burger and the onions, tomatoes, bacon, pickles added a freshness and crispness that blended well with the burger and bun. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy with a nice crispy breadcrumb topping....well worth the upcharge for a premium side dish.  Add some chicken and it is a dish in its own right. My husband like his lunch....same as mine without all the add ons, lol but with the endless fries. He's not easily impressed so food is food, not something to ""Yelp"" about, lol.  We did order a second serving of the endless fries but it took a while.  We paid our bill and ended up leaving without the second helping. Not a big deal but i would recommend ourdering your ""endless fries""  when your plate arrives.  That way, you actually get them in a timely manner when you are almost done with the first serving.  (Just a recommendation.) Overall, it was a nice lunch.  I took a star due to for not getting my food correct/temp of correct add ons.  I'm not sure the disconnect between what the waitstaff writes down and what the cooks ""understand"" but there is no reason that the waitstaff can't check orders to make sure things are correct.  (I did that as a waitress.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler,3.08,3.02,3.02,,3.0440000000000005

I had ordered online for 10 people, some with dietary preferences. When one of our guys went to pick it up the Red Robin team went through the order to ensure it was correct. Everyone raved about the food, flavor, and noted that everything was perfect -but that is just the Red Robin way.. It is the staff (in this case Manager Tim and his Team) who create a lasting impression and we will be ordering again in the future!! Thank you Tim and Team - Beyond excellent in every way!!

The food is amazing here and we always get asked if we want more but his lady was trying to rush us out the door. I had to ask three times for more Mac and cheese, she finally brought it to us cold! Did not ask us if we wanted more fries, and did not bring more water out! We clicked the call server button 2-3 times and all the waiters would look at it walking away! Finally we had to get something to go for my mother so we told her and it took 30 more minuets! It was a simple cheeseburger with fries, we even watched people get their food and we ordered this first!

They served me old fries, my husbands buns were falling apart, and my kids did not like the chocolate milk. We usually eat at the Gilbert San Tan Village location and the food is good. I did not like this visit. They sat us in a very dark corner. It was so dark I had to use the light to my phone so my children can color. Probably won't be visiting this location anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler,3.16,2.98,2.98,,3.0520000000000005

I ordered my second serving and received a completely diff type of mac and cheese I think it was a kids. So I told the server ans got the correct kind. Once we paid I looked at the bill and I was charged the substition fee which I knew I was going to be charged, but I was also charged an extra 2.99.  Last time I was at this location I ordered a salad and asked for tbe dressing on the side. I never recieved any dressing at all. The server never came by to see if we needed anything so I wasnt able to ask for my dressong until everyone was finished eating. I took my salad home and ate it with my dressing. It was good I just wish I could have eaten it at the table with everyone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chandler,3.12,3.0,3.0,,3.0480000000000005
21,David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,1.0,2017-12-02,"Ever had a craving for something you used to love but hadn't had in a long time? That was me tonight for Red Robin.  Oh so silly.  Guacamole bacon burger now nearly $12. What! Tried the ""big"" Tavern Taco Burger. At $10 it's the same size patty as the guac burger. To be fair, it was cooked properly and tasted decent.  But it's not a $10 burger.  Asked for a monster chocolate,  raspberry shake.  Only $5. But it's 1/2 the size it used to be. Didn't taste raspberry at all. I'm pretty certain they used to use real, hard, ice cream. What they use now comes out of a soft serve machine. If it is still ""ice cream,"" then it's 10% milk fat. Runner who brought meal didn't ask if I needed anything. Catsup would have been nice. Bottomless fries are only bottomless if more are offered. They weren't until I was clearly completely done. Bartender/ server had other things on his mind. Looks like there might be a group of regulars. Nice guy. Distracted. Or didn't care.  It's very rare that I don't tip.  I didn't.  Will have to beat down future cravings. Darn. Used to patronize this chain a lot.

Manager told me they messed up but he wouldn't offer anything for the screw up. In short, entire burger was ruined, I paid for items I didn't get, and spent over $50.00 for food I couldn't eat. The restaurants response was basically, ""Oh that order would require more than the absolute minimal effort, and brain power beyond that which we employ here.""
