matt p.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,5.0,9/25/2016,Looks like a dive but actually a very very good Indian restaurant.  Takeaway is good and reasonably priced.  But the food tastes even better eaten in the humble setting.  Great Goan specialties.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-restaurant-and-takeaway-london
