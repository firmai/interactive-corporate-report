Steve M.,"Lambertville, NJ",21,41,235,5.0,3/21/2016,I went to this Applebee's restaurant with my Daughter &Amy Son Inlaw! I was greeted right away when I walked in! The restaurant had about 10 tables sat when we were sat right away! Our server was very nice! The food we got was great last night ! The restaurant was very clean! As you seen from the photos I posted it even had a great appearance too! I got the French onion soup! It was pretty good! I also got the steak parmigiana with the shrimp on it ! It was great I would recommend it to people to get! I do like the server advised me that a coupon I got on Veterans Day from the restaurant was expired and they still took it ! I do know they support our active duty and Veterans ever year with a special menu to show there appreciation to all our military! The manager came by to check on us while we were eating! I think it is huge that they do that ! To me it shows the truly care about there customers! I do recommend this place to all to go and eat! Please follow me if you like my reviews!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Melissa S.,"Flemington, NJ",149,71,361,5.0,4/21/2017,"I love the atmosphere here and of course the service!  Wednesday is my favorite day of the week to visit because it is Ladies Night and they have a $10 sangria pitcher special all night long!  My favorite is the White Peach Sangria, but they also have a Red Apple Sangria too for Red Wine lovers!  The bartender Nicole is extremely personable and always is very welcoming and makes me feel like I'm right at home! On my last visit, Nicole made these wonderful Cinnamon Toast Crunch shots, taking the extra effort to rim the shot glasses with cinnamon and sugar, as well as topping the shots off w a sprinking of cinnamon! Yum! The presentation was amazing! Try one the next time you go to Applebee's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Astrid L.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",26,5,7,1.0,4/18/2017,"We usually go here from time to time. We decided to eat dinner here tonight. RON was our server. He was nice kinda hyper. Didnt  bother us,  First was the appetizer chicken wings was too salty we did not mind - celery looks more scallion stalk- i did try taking pictures of the celery thought it was funny but light flash on my phone was too scandalous so i just let go- we got our hot meals after 10mins of eating and consumed only 25% . Ron came up to ask "" everything ok? .. Do you want box?? We were kinda shock we just said we are ok. We though he will just leave us alone. After 1 min he came up again and handed our ""Bills"" man mind you we just got our food literaly like 10mins ago.. We lost it  Lost our appetite. Decided just to leave and take our meals at home. We asked for a box- which he gave us 1 box at first?! There was 2 plate full of food gave us 1 tiny box. We still didnot loose our shit- politely ask for another box that he complied-  son of a gun he didnot even bother giving us a bag- we still didnot loose our shit- walked out of the place with out making any scene, fights, breaking tables or watso ever.. No police lolz..  Applebees(RON)  you suck tonight man!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Yuppi C.,"Manchester Township, NJ",3,226,50,3.0,4/3/2017,"Because it's Applebee's and a chain restaurant I'm defaulting the review to 3 stars. I honestly didn't want to go there. Food looked average. Service was good. One person's plate looked like the portion was small for the price. I tried the Cheeseburger Eggrolls and really liked them, but I refused to have a meal there. The sauce had a nice pickle tang. I just had the appetizer and a drink and then went to eat dinner elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Krista V.,"Landing, NJ",0,49,1,1.0,12/27/2016,"Bad experience here.  Went with a party of 9 at 4pm when it was completely dead.  Server was very rude and kept saying ""sounds good"" as a response to everything, relevant or not.  Eight of our entrees took over an hour to come out and one was so overcooked we couldnt cut through it with a steak knife (it was chicken).  One entree was completely forgotten about and the guest was so shy and embarassed he didnt even speak up until a family member noticed he was sharing his brother's food.  Apparently the meal was sitting in the kitchen the entire time and nobody noticed.  No excuse for this.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Debbie K.,"Flemington, NJ",149,177,2588,2.0,7/30/2015,"I've been coming to this location for quite sometime now. They have remodeled the place to look more cleaner. The decor is based on the local sporting events and schools in the area, which shows they support their community.  The service seems nice however not always attentive. The food over the years has gone down hill. They're so many other restaurants and chain restaurants in the area, Applebee's from now on will be on the bottom of my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Cat D.,"Washington Township, NJ",0,3,,5.0,11/9/2015,We were hanging out in Flemington having a great and fun lunch at Applebee's. They offer a great lunch combo if you are interested in a having a few options together such as soup/salad/sandwich/entry pick two. I had the fish and chips yum crispy and perfectly cooked.  Outstanding manager Dante Palmieri  stopped at every table including our table inquired about our food and service and then brought to our attention Applebee's policy on free meals for veterans on Veterans Day an personally invited us to invite our veteran friends and family to come in on Wednesday.  Help me support companies like Applebee's who give back to our most valuable citizens - Veterans go to Applebee's today and everyday good food good service good time  Our server Conner good personality great server and cute. Go to Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Tim O.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",0,19,,4.0,1/4/2016,"Staff is very nice, and the food comes out promptly and is always consistent good.  My wife and I love the spinach and artichoke dip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Zak T.,"Kent, WA",4,15,11,5.0,2/13/2015,"We had my Mom's 80th Birthday Party here on 2/8/15 at Lunch Time.  26 people. Gina the hostess put us in a section by ourselves.  We were there 4 hours.  Travis, at least I think is his name was Travis, my faulty memory, did a fantastic job taking care of our group. The food was hot and everyone ordered something different off the menu.  We had people coming from all over New Jersey and PA to meet up. No one complained and everyone seemed to enjoy the food.  Service for 26 people is always a challenge but Travis did a great job and other staff helped with food delivery.  We did have 1 bill. The only mistake was a 1 extra beer no one seemed to order. The only con, I think we rated at least one other staffer for our group, but Travis did a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
J J.,"New York, NY",11,38,,5.0,11/3/2015,"Honestly, if you're in the Flemington area it's the best place to watch sports. There aren't any sports bars, and on Sunday they have every NFL game on decent sized HD tvs. Other than that it's your typical Applebees. The staff is nice and the managers are friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
S H.,"RINGOES, NJ",0,12,,2.0,8/4/2016,"Have used Carside to Go for a couple years and usually don't have a problem.  However, we placed a simple order the other day (1 appetizer, an entree, and a salad).  The salad was a new one on the menu- I could not pull up a description on the phone app of the salad ingredients, so I asked the guy taking the Carside order. Neither he nor another employee could tell me what were the ingredients, so they got a menu and read it to me.  After hearing the ingredients including a yummy-sounding dressing, I decided to order it (grilled watermelon and spicy chicken with a lime-yogurt dressing).  My husband picked it up, and unfortunately did not discover until he arrived home that there was no dressing given.  The salad was great but I was disappointed not to have the dressing.  The next time we use Carside, we will be checking for all items ordered before we drive away.  It wasn't a complicated order, and the staff need to be educated better on new items!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Annie B.,"Annandale, NJ",0,32,,1.0,10/21/2014,"Been there once, did not expect too much from a chain restaurant and of course my expectation were exceeded when waitress brought menus to the table and they were covered with crusted food pieces. Food terrible, charred burger, tough chicken",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
Michael T.,"Flemington, NJ",23,37,,4.0,7/4/2013,"Not a huge fan of chain restaurants but dinner today was pretty great.   Shared sampler with family, was great.  Spin and artichoke dip is amazing.  I had French onion soup which was better than average.  And my meal was off the new menu, the 4 oz. blackened steak and lettuce wedge.  Steak was surprisingly great and lettuce wedge was very good as well.  They re-did all the walls as well at the Flemington location and it looks great. Definitely more inviting with new scenery and new menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington

Joe F.,"High Bridge, NJ",13,46,,3.0,9/11/2008,"The usual Applebee's food and drinks, always busy but always a place to sit, wait staff is friendly and the service is fast, manager always comes by to ask if everything is cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-flemington
