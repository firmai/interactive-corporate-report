I love the bread here & she even gave me more bread so I can take some home. We asked a bunch of questions about the menu & she was honest about which dishes she liked or which weren't that great. We were also her last table but we didn't feel rushed or anything.  ALSO! My friend thought one of the servers were cute & she was like ""I could talk to him for you!"" She's a server & cupid haha!  She made the experience so awesome. She has a very happy & friendly personality, very easy to talk to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Arleen L.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Was here for dinner on a Monday night with a party of 11.  Had to wait an hour as CCF does not takereservations. For appetizers, we ordered some zucchini sticks n fried calamari. When people began to munch on the calamari we realized some pieces were actually fried chicken. We brought it to the waitress' attention and she just chuckled and said ""You got both. Don't know what the cooks are doing"" and off she went.  As dinner plates were being served, the waitress informed J there was no bread for her avocado toast so she needed to order something else. No bread?? Really??? ‍‍It gets worse. After everyone else aside from J got there orders placed in front of them, H was informed by the waitress that his fish tacos were made wrong  as they were beef so she chose not to bring it over. Poor H had to watch us all eat while his tacos were being made. Waitress did not apologize or offer to comp the tacos or offer at slice of cheesecake.  Sorry to say the CCF has gone down in quality and service. I will not be returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Kristina K.,"Fremont, CA",36,10,2,4.0,1/2/2018,"Either a restaurant stands out for how good they are, or how opposite of good they are. And for that, they deserve recognition.  In this case, as much as I love the decor and ambiance of Cheesecake, my favorite thing here is their carrot cake.  In my recent culinary adventures I have been picking up a lot of take out lately, and visiting numerous restaurants on the peninsula.  The last time I was in Cheesecake picking up a take out order I double checked to make sure I had everything and left the store. As I was getting ready to pull out, the employee who was helping me suddenly appeared tapping on my window startling me and holding up a bag in his hands. It was my fries! Now that's what I call service and going above and beyond the call of duty! I asked his name and he told me it's Neil. Neil is awesome and truly exemplifies the meaning of hospitality in every way shape and form. I also told him inside at the counter that no matter how old a woman gets she still likes being called Miss as opposed to Ma'am and he began calling me Miss and corrected himself everytime he almost said Ma'am.  It's people like him that make me want to go back to cheesecake and explore the menu until I find something I love on the menu. Outstanding service and warm hospitality sometimes mean more than the food itself and even make it taste better.  Neil deserves a promotion and would make a great Manager with his natural warmth and genuine care he clearly exhibits. Winner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Tiffany L.,"Burlingame, CA",109,115,435,4.0,12/9/2017,"I came here with my family on a Sunday evening and we all enjoyed our dinner. Service was friendly enough but extremely slow. It took around 25 min to get seated, 30 min to get our food, and another 15 minutes to order and receive our cheesecake. Luckily we had plenty of freshly baked sourdough and wheat bread to tide us over. I absolutely love their honey wheat brown bread - it's sweet, crusty, and hearty.  Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu, and there are a decent number of vegetarian options. I've always enjoyed their veggie burger - the housemade patty is a well-seasoned blend of grains and veggies. This time I wanted to try something different and went with the super antioxidant salad. The toppings were all delicious, especially the roasted broccoli, but they really skimped out. I received a giant bowl of salad greens with very few toppings, which is unacceptable for the price ($11.49). Perhaps I'll have better luck trying out one of their vegetarian pasta dishes next time. Let's be honest though, I totally came to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake and not the entrees. In particular I've been waiting to try the Celebration Cheesecake and it did not disappoint!! It had so many different layers: funfetti cake, cheesecake, strawberry/chocolate/vanilla mousse, and cream cheese frosting. It reminded me of Baked Alaska but even more decadent. I'm a sucker for anything funfetti, so the Celebration Cheesecake easily became my favorite. Some of my other go-to cheesecakes are: fresh strawberry, fresh banana cream, and tiramisu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo

Came in folks were behind me asking for tables while I'm standing at the counter no paging device issued no help given these people are unprofessional holding conversations at the counter. I watched the staff give new customers who walked in a pager while I'm sitting here without one. I walk up and was told we don't have anymore hmmmm interesting I just saw you give out THREE oh I don't know I guess you have to wait the other ones are broken.

Called 3 times and Waited on hold a total of 25 min and still didn't get anyone to take my order. It's bad enough the wait times can be a bit long, but who has time to wait on hold to place a to go order.

Amy D.,"Fremont, CA",474,2309,5375,4.0,11/4/2017,"Although I didn't love all the new dishes I tried this time around, I'm staying with a 4 star rating since the food here is solid, and service was surprisingly good this time around. Apparently, coming for lunch on a Thursday around noon is the best time, since there was no wait and not crazy busy. We were seated right away, and I tried: -Korean Fried Cauliflower ($5.95): This is still a great appetizer, and the flavors are really good. The cauliflower was also nice and crispy- highly recommended! -Dynamite Shrimp (Crispy Tempura Shrimp w/Spicy Dynamite Sauce, $7.95,  ): Not that great- the batter on the shrimp was too thick, and the dynamite sauce wasn't spicy and didn't have much flavor. Skip! -Crispy Chicken Costoletta (Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded & Sauteed to a Crisp Golden Brown, Served w/Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes, Fresh Asparagus, $17.95,  ): Just ok- they give you a giant plate of chicken (3 pieces) and mound of mashed potatoes, but the sauce was really bland. There was a nice crisp on the chicken, and that was pretty flavorful. However, the mashed potatoes could have also used additional flavor. I probably wouldn't get this dish again. -Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake ( ): Way too sweet, and the walnuts were weird in here. I also didn't like the combination of flavors with the cookie dough and cheesecake- skip! Our server was actually competent this time around, and our food came out quickly, which was great! I will definitely be back to The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Sarika S.,"San Jose, CA",126,360,99,4.0,10/17/2017,"Though this is one of the smallest of their restaurants I have been to, it's overall the same consistent food I expect.  I met up with some friends to have apps/dinner here. Since it was early, we opted to do happy hour but there was only 4 tables and a few seats at the bar. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table to clear. Our waiter was nice and friendly, even let us know a few min before HH was ending so we could place more of an order, but we didn't need anything else.  Like I said above, food is usually consistent. One thing, this place had a few tables on the mall part of the area lobby, not outside. I've seem in at one other place in southern CA. But it's weird because people are waiting there too so I'm sure they are staring at you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo

They've recently improved their cocktail menu too so more reason to hangout here with friends! Service has always been nice and fast, despite them being always busy. I never see this restaurant slow.

Yoyo L.,"San Mateo, CA",46,79,297,4.0,7/15/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is never a wrong choice for either lunch or dinner, especially Dessert! Except you have to be patient to wait in line. My husband and I went there for a Friday date night, but unfortunately 45mins wait time just way too long around 6:30pm. We had to buy some snacks before getting our table, otherwise we probably starved to death, lol.  So we finally get seated, and immediately ordered our food. Signature burger with whole wheat bread. And my favorite pasta with fried chicken on the top. The service was nice and fast! Didn't wait long for our food! After we finished everything, we were just too full to order dessert, haha.  Red velvet has always been my favorite. Just saying.  Hope next time we can come earlier so we don't have to wait too long!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Tiffany H.,"South San Francisco, CA",242,131,222,2.0,6/22/2017,"After our table tracker finally rang to notify us a table was ready, we ended up waiting another 5 minutes. Why? I have no idea, the person who was supposed to sit us down walked away with nobody and came back looking all confused as to why we were standing there.  Sat down at 6:50pm and the waiter didn't come to get our drink order until 7pm, which by that time, we were ready to order our food too. All we asked to drink was water but that took a whopping six mins. I guess it took awhile because the waiter was getting bread too? But it wasn't hot or anything so I'm not sure what the holdup was. While waiting for our food to come, our party of four finished the bread and asked for more. This time the bread was warm and took only three minutes! In addition to our bread, they were holding onto drinks and bread from other tables as well. Three minutes is pretty good, which makes me wonder why it took so long earlier.  Once our food came, we were just kinda left alone. This has its benefits and drawbacks. Benefits: we can focus on us and our food. Drawbacks: if we needed our waiter for anything it was hard to flag them down, especially when we were done eating and just sitting here waiting...  About the food: Personally I ordered the chicken Marsala with mushroom pasta. The chicken was well cooked and was not too chewy and soft. I really don't like to eat overcooked chicken that gets dry and chewy so I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pasta itself had enough sauce. A weird thing to note is that aside from the bow tie pasta that came with my food also had a decent amount of spaghetti. Now that we have waited so long for the waiter to come back, we are all pretty full so no dessert unfortunately. When she finally came around, we told her we were too full and asked for our boxes but she walked off too quickly before we can ask for the check but she came back pretty quickly with it.  Why did I rate this place 2 stars? Well beginning from 5 stars, -1 for inconsistency and confusion in waiting time at the front to be seated, -1 for inconsistent waiting time for water/bread, -1 for just sitting there waiting for the waiter to come back so we can get boxes and the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Theresa M.,"San Carlos, CA",5,106,116,5.0,12/10/2017,"What does 49ers Jimmy G have in common with Anthony's Boubon Radioactive?  Fast, speedy and a winner!  CF typically great like all Cheesecake Factory throughout SoCal (San Diego) to Norcal (Sacramento and Bay Area).  But this particular Bay Area CF other than the usual hefty serving of indulgence good enough for a football team (to be fair there is also a Skinny menu) they have Anthony the Bartender who hikes up some unbelievable drinks. Today he made ""Bourbon Radioactive"" (privy to actually have the opportunity to name this particular drink) and it was good, no, very good, no absolutely hands down good!!!  Fast.  Speedy.  Winner.  Been awhile since returning here to watch his plays because there's always been a scrimmage (people lining up to sit at the bar so they can be served by Anthony).  The high tops are usually what's left and basically you remain in the sidelines.  No Anthony too.  But today, like a Hail Mary...scored!  Showdown went like this:  It was already late in the quarter but got seats at the bar, defense was good, first down!  Fought way through and gained more yards after ordering food (always a variety and consistent)  ie., nachos, chicken sliders, spicy nugget, pot stickers, salads are yumsters, pasta, and carnevors will not be disappointed.  Also had Sundae for dessert and also available are what seems like endless cheesecake choices, second down!  Then here comes Anthony and hikes up his creation ""Bourbon Radioactive"" and Receiver does his thing and passes for a touchdown!!!

Amy C.,"Newark, CA",1521,984,1733,3.0,6/3/2017,"I think people should go to the Cheesecake Factory if they are going to get cheesecake only.  Otherwise, don't come here. First of all, everything is so high calorie! It's too much!  The menu is definitely extensive with so many different options, but it seems that all categories are just so fattening. These days I'm trying to be a bit more health conscious so I wasn't a fan of this place. My friend insisted on coming here for dinner cause she wanted cheesecake, but in the end, she didn't even order her damn cheesecake. Ugh.  I wanted to order the Ahi Tuna Salad, but they were out of it. So I settled on the Factory Chopped Salad which I didn't read fully before ordering since the girl was pressuring me into picking something. I hated that it had bleu cheese in the salad. Gross. Yeah, I'm one of those people who don't like bleu cheese. Yuck.  My friend got a chicken entree and a tatertot appetizer which she thought was tasty. Originally she was going to get the stuffed mushrooms, but surprise- they were out.  I know it was a holiday (Memorial Day), but it still suck to be out of things.  I love their cheesecakes!

Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2001,829,6047,2.0,3/2/2017,"I've been to my share of Cheesecake Factories and this San Mateo location is one of the worst ones I've been to, due to service, wait time (of the food), and the quality of the food. So this location is located in the Hillsdale Mall - meaning that the wait time can get super long. And even though they give you the beepers that will vibrate when it's time for you to be seated, the signal doesn't reach too far so you pretty much have to wait around Cheesecake. When we arrived on a weekday night, we were told that the wait would be over an hour long. We decided to wait it out, and luckily it only took about 30 or so minutes.  But the wait for our waitress to take our order, refill our drinks, refill our bread, bring us the check - we ended up staying at the restaurant way longer than we should have. She seemed to be having a really bad day, her face reflecting her somber mood, which definitely translated in how she served her customers. We could tell that she really did not want to be there.  The complimentary bread was good, and we got seconds because the wait for the food was too long. Shirley Temple was also decent if you want a refreshing drink.  As for the food: Miso Salmon: This has always been one of my favorite dishes from Cheesecake, but I don't order it too often because it is on the pricier side. The overall taste was not too bad, but it wasn't as fresh or as vibrant as I've had at other locations. The rice beneath the salmon was a bit too hard, but the sauce and the salmon were tasty. This was one of the better dishes of the night.  Factory combination of 2 dishes: herb crusted salmon and the steak Diane along with mashed potatoes. This was not too bad, except that the herb crusted salmon paled in comparison to the miso salmon. Not as tasty, more dry, not as flavorful - the steak Diane was okay. I've been to a location where their steak Diane was horrible, so luckily the flavor was decent here. Nothing wowing about the two dishes, but I did like the mashed potatoes! This dish came out way later than the other two dishes, which was pretty sad considering we were almost done eating the other dishes.  Tomato Basil Pasta: not a bad pasta dish, although it could have used more sauce. Comes with chicken and fresh mozzarella along with penne pasta. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked - definitely lacking in salt, but nothing bad about the dish.  Cheesecakes:  Had to go with the fresh strawberry cheesecake since it's the most popular. And I can see why! The original topped with fresh glazed strawberries and a few dollops of whipped cream - very light and refreshing. The strawberries give a little tartness to the sweetness of the cheesecake, making you want to put another bite into your mouth after you've already inhaled one.  30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake cheesecake: this has layers of the original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream along with one dollop of whipped cream. This is very rich in chocolate taste, but not too overwhelming due to the layers of original cheesecake. I liked it! Very fudgy and definitely on the sweet side. I would reorder this again as well!  tl;dr - The biggest drawback was probably the poor service and the amount of time we had to wait for our food. Food seemed to be lacking, but the cheesecakes were good - thank goodness they can have consistent cheesecake. Don't think I'd return to this location if I was in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo
Em P.,"San Francisco, CA",503,163,127,1.0,7/31/2017,"0 STARS!!! Hearing of the Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo makes me cringe.  Here's my story. It's my mom's birthday. She just had surgery and had gone through all sorts of health problems and her request on her birthday was to eat at Cheesecake Factory. I called and spoke to a manager whose name is Craig. I explained my situation about my mom and how I really wanted to make it extra special for her. He was super nice on the phone, he explained they didn't take reservations but that he was going to take care of my family when we got there. He was very accommodating assuring me that he will make this a great experience for us and to ask for him by name.  I didn't expect to have a red carpet treatment or anything, but I do expect a manager to abide by his word and not mislead me into thinking that he was going to accommodate my party of 10, but in all reality he was not going to. After hauling my family of 10, I was told we would have to wait 2 hours! I asked for Craig the manager and this lady wearing a yellow jacket said that I could not speak to him and he's busy. C'mon! Their number one priority should be customers especially unhappy ones! After insisting that I see this man for myself and for him to tell me to my face how he was dishonest on the phone, the mysteriousCraig finally made an appearance.  I spoke to him and he just kept twisting his words. Saying I didn't say this and that and how you're gonna have to wait like everyone else it. (Which would have been fine if he didn't tell me on the phone to ask for him by name and assured me that he would make my mom's birthday a very special one.) It is completely dishonest, misleading and rude of a manager to say I will take care of your party upon arrival and then say, ""Actually never mind, I never said that."" Terrible customer service. I will not make the same mistake next time to bring my family here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo

The food was atrocious (even by Cheesecake Factory standards) and the service was non-existent. We ordered the Dynamite Shrimp  and the plate was dripping with oil when it was brought to our table. I could only taste the strong oil in every bite I took and I'm not sure if there was any taste to the shrimp or the sauce that the dish was served with. All of this was after they took 40 mins to serve the appetizer on a not so busy Thursday night.  We should have ideally left after this with our takeaway order of cheesecakes but we took a chance and ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta.

It is clearly false advertising to advertise curbside on your website and not provide it.  Worse of all, it was Valentine's Day so thought we'd eat at home.

I accidentally spilled my soda and one of the employees took care of it super quick. The server sort of made it seem like it was a problem that it had happened. Oh well! Accidents happen.... it wasn't that big of a deal!.. For my entree, I ordered a fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it was okay. Portions are big, but I still don't think it is worth the amount they charge. I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60
Navid N.,"San Mateo, CA",142,19,4,2.0,4/3/2017,"I've been to this establishment countless times. There are times where I come out happy, but also times where I didn't receive my food at all. This review summarizes my dinner I had two months ago to celebrate Valentines Day with my family. We came to have dinner on Saturday night, but we were told that the wait would be over an hour and a half long. We decided to wait until a bar seat was opened, no luck. So we waited about half an hour, early actually, to receive a table. The waiter was very nice and did her best to make sure that we were taken care of, but the long wait for food AND bread AND drinks didn't help her cause. For dinner, I had the Factory Burger, which has been one of my favorites. The overall taste was average, but it wasn't as delicious as it was in previous visits. The burger was on the dry side, but the special sauce gave it needed flavor. But I wasn't give my fries, and it finally caught the waiter's eye when she came to take my empty plate and saw my fries plate was missing. She was kind enough to give me an order of fries on the house, so props to her. For desert, I went with the fresh Vanilla bean cheesecake since I LOVE Vanilla. The Vanilla Cream with the texture of the pie crust plus the whipped cream - offered a delectable contrast. Overall, I was very happy with my desert. The food was good, but there's that one major problem that keeps overshadowing my experience here. That is the the poor service, the amount of time to get a table, and the amount of time we had to wait for our food. Honestly, I feel like the presentation and taste of the food keeps getting poorer and poorer with each visit, but the cheesecakes were good - which is one aspect of the dinner which I'm not complaining about. If there was another Cheesecake Factory nearby, I would go there, but because this is the nearest one to my house, I'm stuck with this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60
Angela S.,"Burlingame, CA",104,12,1,4.0,6/30/2017,"I really like this place. They're always very clean and they're very attentive, I think you just have to ask them if you want a certain type of service and the way you want it. In my experience here, if I asked the waitress or bartender for something specifically I've always gotten it. My friends haven't been as happy but that's the reason for my four stars. When you walk in the door you're seated immediately and the bar is nearly almost always open with seats if you just want appetizers. It's located right near the parking spots at the front of the mall, really convenient, really easy to get a quick (great) burger,  or appetizer, or, drink while watching the game at  the TV at the bar.  Four stars is only because my friends disagree with service,  but, they didn't ask for what they wanted, they just assumed. .... and after going with them and asking they now agree that the service is great. Just make sure you ask for what you want, they're very accommodating. Great food , great service great atmosphere for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60
Jen C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,75,,1.0,6/26/2017,I hate this place.  My son loves it.  We needed to buy him clothes so I figured I would feed him dinner before torturing him in Gap.  We were there early.  Seated immediately and then left for dead.  Not a single employee came to our table.  We waited 20 minutes.  At least 6 employees cruised by - ignoring us.  Pretending we weren't really there...  I don't know what was going on but the sad thing is I've experienced this before.  In this same restaurant.  What kind of idiot goes back to an establishment where she was ignored and expects the same thing to NOT happen again?  That idiot is me. After 20 minutes we got up and left.  I'm sure our menus are still sitting on the table where we left them and I'm pretty sure no one ever came by... Right now there are three places to eat at Hillsdale Mall.  Once that food court is open I hope The Cheesecake Factory will be a ghost town...  If you value your time don't waste it here.    Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60

Danika P.,"San Leandro, CA",364,332,1209,3.0,2/19/2017,"Loved the food, but service was terrible. First of all it was not busy at all and yet we had to wait for about 10 minutes until we were seated super secluded in the back. First our server started off good, but then it went bad. She ordered our appetizer and it came the same time as our main dish. We ordered the loaded bake potato bite and it never came. She came by to our table to tell us it's on the way over. As soon as she said that the manager came to our table to apologize and let us know that our order went to the wrong table. So to make up for it a slice of cheesecake was on the house. We figured that was so sweet and he mentioned our first order of appetizer would be removed from the check, but when we looked at our bill the check included the loaded baked potato which we never received. So we had to fix our check and it made it super inconvenient for us because we had to wait even longer for a fixed check. For a main dish i ordered the chicken and biscuit which was delicious and filling. I should mention the portion was huge. As for dessert I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake because it was finally in season and I loved it. I forgot what my cousins ordered, but we were pleased with our food. I don't think i'll come back to this location due to service, but I do recommend people who do live on this side of the bay to try it. Food portion is good and reasonably twice, but do order cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60

Liza W.,"Moss Beach, CA",82,214,83,3.0,2/3/2017,"According to the Yelp standards of what three stars mean, then, yes, The Cheesecake Factory at Hillsdale is ""A-OK"". I give this place a fairly decent review not because this is the most stellar place to have dinner (it is a chain restaurant of course), but because, where else can you bring a five year old for her birthday and get food she will actually eat at reasonable prices, in an atmosphere that is loud enough to drown out your kid's restaurant shenanigans, yet cozy and dimly lit enough to trick yourself into feeling like you are out to a ""fancy"" dinner? Why, that would be The Cheesecake Factory, at the mall. Yay, mall. Also, my child is head over heels for the Build-A-Bear a couple doors away, so she gets her annual birthday Build-A-Bear, and then we hop over to The Cheesecake Factory for a casual birthday dinner with new toy in tow. Happy Birthday to a little one! All of the above reasons are why there are multitudes of families waiting by the dozen to be seated at this restaurant on any given evening, especially on the weekends. The typical wait for the dinner-busy hour is around 20 minutes. Expect that, every time. It could be longer and it could be shorter, but don't hold your breath. I don't frequent here much, but when I have come here on occasion, the service has been mostly pretty decent. Tonight, on a Friday night that was extra busy, we lucked out with an excellent server. And it really is sheer luck. I eat from the Skinnylicious menu here. Let me tell you, the skinny menu is the saving grace of this place, otherwise you are eating a billion calories at a time. All of the entree choices on the skinny menu are 590 calories or less. They also have ""Skinnylicious"" drink choices which are 150 calories or less (so I always get the skinny Margarita on the rocks). From the skinny menu, I had the steak medallions which came with mashed potatoes (a very small portion!), asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and shiitake mushrooms. Oh my god! OH my god! I honestly could not believe how good this meal was. The steak was cooked to perfection. The marinated sauce on the mushrooms (which normally I dont like Shiitakes at all) and the lightly sauted tomatoes with asparagus was all so mouth wateringly delicious! Part of what keeps the calories down on the skinny menu are that the portions are normal sized, not hugely gigantic  like the portions on Cheescake's regular menu. I was so surprised at how good the medallions were that I kept announcing how good it was while I was eating it, hahaha. My daughter's bow tie pasta with fresh marinara was light, cooked perfectly and really tasty as well. The cheesecake was bypassed this time, because a very chocolate, chocolate birthday cake was waiting at home for my one-track minded newly-minted five year old! But, the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries is usually a favorite to share with the table (a couple bites is enough!). I can't eat all that crazy crazy sweet stuff they make the Cheesecakes into, but apparently that is what people love about this place.  Anyhow, if you come here, be prepared for longish waits, especially on the weekends. Don't arrive if your kids are already starving because they will be melting down by the time you get a seat and as all parents know, when that happens, you have hit that cranky button that is hard to turn off. If you accommodate this place and its long wait times, then you can make this place is an occasional go-to for families. It is decent enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=60

Mariah B.,"Union City, CA",346,6,,1.0,12/10/2017,"I came here for my birthday and was told I had a 40 minute wait. The first thing was I asked for a table for 5 and they wrote me down for a table for 2 and we ended up having to wait longer for an available table. They tried to scramble up a small table that could not seat any of us comfortably so we had to wait even longer for them to actually accommodate us with an adequately sized table. While we were waiting I overheard a hostess asking a customer for their number, I misinterpreted the conversation and thought they had a texting system that would let you know when your table was ready. However, when I asked if I could put my number down for texting updates, the hostess rudely cut me off and said that wasn't an option and proceeded to sarcastically me and explain what texting systems are and she doesn't have the capability to ""text every single person who is waiting for a table"". I then explained that I had heard her ask another woman for her number and thought that she was putting her number down so she could get text updates. The hostess kept cutting me off and looking at me crazy and didn't help me understand the context of that conversation. So, annoyed, i left to wait for my table...just to hear her give ANOTHER Customer the option to put their number down so they can get called when their table was ready....literally all i wanted was the option to be contacted when my table was ready. Whether or not it was a phone call or text the host knew what I was asking for because I asked her how if I could walk around the mall for a little while I was waiting and not miss my table being called.  Now fast forward to the meal, my sister ordered calamari and after about a 25-30 minutes everyone's meals were served except for the calamari. It took us another 10 minutes to catch the attention of a server who then told us that it was ""unservable"" but for 40 minutes never told us. On top of that I ordered a spicy chicken pasta and it was extremely sweet and so I had to send it back and our waitress walked past our table multiple times without coming to retake my sisters order or mine. We had to walk up and ask her to come back. We ended up asking to get the orders to go but they still served the meals on plates so we had to wait again as they put our meals in to go boxes. Overall our service was extremely crappy. And as ""apologetic"" as the workers were that didn't replace the effort or attention they could have put in knowing that we were all visibly upset.

Joey Z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,4,1.0,11/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is well known for their awesome desserts although a little pricey, it's worth it. But my memory of the Restaurant at the Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo CA should be a wake up for management to create a plan of action when things get hectic. I was waiting at the to-go counter to get a slice, maybe two of my favorite cheesecakes. The young man behind the counter seemed to have several technical difficulties at the cash register. Therefore catering to one customer for over 30 minutes. Meanwhile the line started to grow. And since the crowd would not fit the welcoming area, the one line became two or three. I also noticed an older couple claiming to be in front of me but I know for sure the husband wasn't. I asked the person at the front desk if that was the only cash register that took take out orders and she said that that was it. Um....where is management's plan B on this? Why are they allowing customers to get impatient so as to verbally abuse their employees? Oh yeah there was one who was in a dress shirt and tie who tried to assist our poor young man behind the takeout counter with the technical difficulty but left him again and again by himself unresolved resulting for that young man to run across the restaurant a few times, talk about safety issues. SO - I just left and told the person at the front that that poor employee had to cater to one customer for over 30 minutes. I had to leave before I would have said something I might regret - Lesson here is: Stay  away from the Cheesecake Factory from Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo during peak hours because management seem to not have the skill to train their employees what to do to ease crowd control",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=40

Like so many chain restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory has a hard time with consistency in quality, availability, and service.  We've had some REALLY GOOD dishes here... only to return and be disappointed with REALLY BAD versions of the same dishes.  Often items on the menu are not even available. One of my favorite dishes is the lemon chicken served with carrots, greens, and mashed potatoes.  When done well, it's truly a work of art.  But sometimes, it turns out to be a disaster with dry, overcooked meat and dried up lemon sauce.  On one visit, I ordered it for dinner only to be told 10 minutes later that it was not available.  Really?!  By the time, the server returned to take my ""new"" order, I was 20 min behind schedule with the rest of my party and completely out of synch. I've had similar highs and lows with plenty of other dishes on the menu. The huevos rancheros used to be another favorite of mine... but they switched things up and no longer serve it on corn tortillas.  Instead they use super greasy, fried tortilla shells and spiced up the dish a lot. My wife introduced me to the coconut curry chicken and shrimp and it was heavenly.  So, on my next visit I ordered it and it was over seasoned and disgusting. Service is also very inconsistent.  In a recent visit, they served my younger son a raw hamburger.  So, we asked to have another one cooked for him.

Yesterday Sunday 11/5/17, Triana our waitress delivered 3 orders of Benedicts to our table totally cold.  We could not find one sole around us at 10:30am to help. Finally the manager came, two of my guests were already eating the cold stuff so the manager took my cold food and replaced it after an 18 minute wait. It ruined our breakfast. I was never offered a fresh cup of coffee or more coffee. The manager took one Bennedict  off my bill but we all know that's not the point.

Laura P.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/8/2018,"As a party of six we arrived at noon on Sunday.  We had two six  year old little boys.   We waited approximately 15 minutes to be seated, which was fine.  We sat and waited for the server to take our drink order.  Half of the order was brought to us.  As we waited, and waited, we were told they could bring half of our order??? WHAT?? No, came together and wanted to EAT together!   We were told that the Thai spring rolls was holding up our order...not a cooked meal...just salad components on a plate!   One of the boys wanted another glass of milk and we were told up front that we would be charged for another glass...no free refills. Well, if we had our meal served on time, we would not have to order another milk to drink with his meal. So, finally at 1:30pm...one by one...our meals arrived! One and a half hour after arriving at the restaurant.  Just happy we didn't go for dinner!  We would have left at midnight!   We had to ask for a refill for the tea pot, sugar for coffee and dressing for the salad.  And we had to wait for those items.  The salad dressing came to late as we were about to leave! We were NEVER asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. So, so disappointed for our New Year family celebration.   Guess we won't be visiting again for a celebration.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=20
Kanella G.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,51,26,2.0,6/29/2017,"I can see why this particular Cheesecake Factory only has a 2 and a half star rating... My friend and I went here today for a late lunch and let me tell you, it was the worst experience we've ever had at any Cheesecake Factory. Literally the second we sat down our server already came up to us, ""hi can I get you something to drink?"" Uhhh okay, water I guess? How are we supposed to know what we want to drink when we haven't even situated ourselves at our table? It's as if she was already standing around waiting for us to sit in her section then she immediately rushes us. Coming from a person who actually serves at another restaurant, we have ONE minute to greet our table. You can at least wait 45 seconds until we have sat down and actually opened the menu for you to greet us, no need to be in a hurry. Every time we've been to a Cheesecake Factory, the server always served bread immediately upon greeting. We had to ask her this time if we can have bread and we got the ""sure"" response. So that's cool too I guess... Food and drinks arrived pretty quickly which was a plus, and it was very tasty. The server tried to rush me again though by trying to take away my plate when I wasn't even finished with it. Kind of an uncomfortable experience, like my friend and I weren't even wanted there. Once we got the bill, we noticed that the server circled the tip examples at the bottom of the paper. Hahahaha are you kidding me? You really think we're that dumb to not know how to tip? Definitely undertipped this girl a lot for her shitty and rushed service, sorry not sorry. I'm not an idiot. Not to mention, she also grabbed the booklet before we even got up from our table to leave the restaurant. Never felt rushed before in my LIFE! We left the restaurant then unfortunately about 10 minutes later, my friend realized he left his phone at the table so we went back and asked whoever was at the host stand if they found a phone. We told him where we sat so he said he would go check on it. We saw him walk towards the kitchen, then to our table, then back to the kitchen, looking like he didn't know what he was doing. So my friend and I just checked the table ourselves and found the phone from there. More idiots that didn't want to help us. Great job!

The line (and the wait) is always pretty long (generally 30 minutes or more) unless you get here early (before 6:00pm on weekdays). The Good:  1.  Compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations in the Bay Area (Palo Alto & SF) parking is much easier. 2.  Extensive menu so everyone can find something that they'll eat  3.  The service is generally decent 4.  Generally big portions *5. The bread (in particular the molasses wheat bread) is really tasty and often is served warm. Also, order the shrimp scampi!  So good!! The Not So Good:  1.  Generally takes awhile to get seated  2.  The quality of the food is probably a B to B+ (it's not Thomas Keller, people!)  3.  A little pricey for the quality I would probably give this place 3.5 stars if half starts were allowed.

Also, I specifically asked for brown rice but received white rice with some pieces of brown rice in it. The few brown rice pieces were super hard as if they cooked white rice on top of old brown rice.  As for the chicken riesling, it was INCREDIBLY salty when we expected it to be sweeter.

More than 40 minutes after order, AND, after first complain. We ordered a salmon, a kid's menue and a filet mignon medium rare, and a side of french fries. 2 couples sat to the tables next to us after we ordered our food. Both couples received their entrees, paid and left before we got our dishes.  I raised my hand to call a nearby waitress. This is when he really knew that there was a problem. He most likely informed our waitress, Champagne, who came  5 minutes later, with the kid's menu, the french fries and the salmon. My filet mignon was not ready. How long does it really take to sizzle a filet mignon? unless they completely forgot my order.  Now.. The food. I asked a filet mignon, supposed to be very tender, medium rare. It arrived burned, hard, and more like between medium rare and well-done. This is really the worst filet mignon of my life. An insult to the French cuisine. I'm sure that Mc Donalds can cook a better medium rare filet mignon if they could do it. What about the french fries? Too salty and cold. I complained to the waitress about the wait and she gave us an attitude, like she could care less. Once I was done with my filet mignon, here comes the check and the waitress was eager to see us leave. Maybe she did not like the fact that we were sitting too long to our table, waiting for our food.

Allie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",521,327,658,2.0,6/25/2017,"Cheesecake factory is my favorite franchise restaurant. I've been to multiple locations and I've had the worst experience at this location so I will not be back to this location.  My party of 4 waited up to 1.5 hours. While we were waiting, we could see so many tables had no one seated and the tables just needed to be cleared. Where were all the bussers??  When we finally got seated and the waiter finally took our order, they didn't have chicken pot pie  or white rice left so we had to order other items on the menu. 20 mins in after we ordered, we still got no complimentary bread. From my previous experiences with Cheesecake factory, you never have to ask them for it and they just bring it to you. So we finally asked the waiter if we could have some. His response was ""Oh..I think we just ran out. Let me check!"" He came back 5 mins later with TWO small pieces for 4 of us. He said ""This is the last two pieces for real of the night."" The funny thing was, we saw on his serving tray there was another bread holder tray with 4 pieces and he served it to the table next to us with only 3 people in the party! My thought of that was because the table next to us was seated much later than us, and they had 3 people in their party only. However, he probably gave it to them since they ran out of most of the food they tried to order. (That table seemed really pissed too since he spent a good 5-10 mins just taking their order and the ran out of all the items they requested). So, the waiter was pretty good at lying. Our first dish we ordered came out 30 minutes after we ordered and each dish after that was another 10 mins after. Our entire experience was approximately 3 hours (wait time included and probably longer).  I won't be back to this location for the long wait and being understaffed and for running out of a lot of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=20

The good at this location is the bartenders do have to work hard which they do and the food is quality like you get from your average Cheesecake factory (this is a good thing).  This particular location is understaffed and can be disorganized. For the plethora of options in San Mateo for miles and miles, they will struggle unless service improves. What drives me crazy is that the Hillsdale mall does not currently have a food court and Paul Martin is super pricey so if TCF was actually solid all-around they would probably be pouring in the customers and cash.

I only came because my cousin wanted to celebrate my birthday earlier and today was the day where everyone was free and not so busy. This location is located next to the mall so it's very crowded around dinner time because ya know, everyone is hungry. Wait time was 45 minutes which wasn't so bad considering on how many people were waiting for a table as well. We got a booth because we had over seven people(eight later on) and we got down to ordering right away. The server was super nice(forgot his name) but he was our server till the end of our stay. We got our drinks and free appetizer aka bread and butter within five minutes... woo!! Since the menu is so grand and so many to choose from, I was super indecisive if i wanted pasta or if I wanted a rice/mash potato plate(it was definitely going to involve some carbs tho ha). I ended up going with my first choice the Cajun jambalaya pasta(linguine pasta w/ shrimp,chicken,peppers, and diced tomatoes). Everyone's food came within ten minutes or less which is amazing considering on how packed this place was. Their portions are huge so you really get what you pay for. After all my pictures and my shenanigans, I got down to eating since it smelled/looked so good. The taste was what I just expected as what it described on their menu. It was the perfect amount of salt with the right amount of spicyness which wasn't too strong to handle. After eating my plate that I literally shared with almost everyone, we ordered one slice of tiramisu cheesecake aka my favorite. The cake looked way too beautiful to eat but it's really good and it's not the type of cheesecake where all you taste I cheese, you really taste the flavor they say it is. Overall the service and the price point you pay for the portions are awesome. I think this is the restaurant to come to if you're looking for something better than Oliver Garden with almost the same prices and a better flavor to their food. One con was that the food was a little too oily for my lips and tongue, I had to constantly wipe my lips down haha.

The managers are super friendly but that DOES NOT make up for bad service almost every time I come in here (and I'm here at least once a week!).

I finally hit my last strike with them when I bought some cheesecake slices one night to eat at home (because I figured: ""how could they mess that up??""). MISTAKE to even ask myself that question considering there was a looooongg HAIR that I didn't even find in my cheesecake slice until I was more than HALF done with it. It kinda just popped out from under the whipped cream that sits on the slice of cake.

David D.,"Hayward, CA",2028,247,1265,4.0,10/29/2015,"The food really isn't the reason to take off stars for a Cheesecake Factory review (I mean it's arguably some of the best chain food you can get with huge portions); it really boils down to service and location.    This location is really good and bad for a few reasons.  It's bad because it's near the mall (which makes it crowded), on the corner of a busy street, and the service is a bit shoddy.  During my visit, we had to wait nearly 10 minutes to be greeted after being seated, and this wasn't good because we were starving and thirsty.  I've been here before and a similar thing happened.  You can navigate the crowds by coming at opportune times: Lunch on weekends, before 5pm on weekdays, and after brunch on Sundays. There's good about this location: It's near the mall, you can walk from across the street and park there (conveniently located by Barnes and Noble), and the food.   I know it may be controversial, but I love the food at Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe it's because I have a relative who worked here and I know the detail that goes into some of the food.  An example would be the lemon ricotta pancakes during Sunday brunch--they're fab and they serve them with real maple syrup.  I love the Crusted Chicken Romano (that sauce omg) and Chicken Fettuccini with Sun-Dried tomatoes but I think the latter has phased out.  My current favorite dish is the Cajun Chicken Littles (see pic); they're really great--the chicken is juicy and fried to perfection, served with mashed potatoes and corn/veggie hash.  I remember when they used to give you a whole ear of corn with this dish!  I guess they needed to increase profits.  Anyway, we also go the chicken n biscuits (see that pic too); they also recently changed this dish--perhaps now it's a little smaller and the biscuits are different, more corn-like and less classic buttermilk--so it's a negative in my view.   Finally, the other reason people come here, the pumpkin cheesecake. It's in season and it's awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=140

Janet T.,"San Mateo, CA",3280,189,1,5.0,6/1/2016,"This is not my first time going to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  This might be like my 5th time eating at this particular one since I moved to San Mateo 11 months ago.  Actually, it is one of my favorite restaurants. I'm not typically crazy for chain restaurants but I think CF has a massive menu, the service is beyond good, and the ambience is relaxing and on point. I was recently having dinner at the CF with four of my best girlfriends. It was Bonnie's special birthday, and whenever it's any of ours birthday, we really have a good time. Since no reservations are allowed, we luckily only had to wait a mere 15 min for a party of 5 on a weeknight at primetime. We each started with a cocktail. I won't bore you with what everyone ordered....just mine. So here goes.... I had a. Cosmopolitan in a fancy glass. It was really tasty!  We ordered a couple of appetizers, since we each were ordering our own Entree.  One appetizer was the Avocado Eggrolls, it's Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion, and Cilantro Fried in a crisp wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. That was to die for!!!!  One of the stars of the evening. Our  second appetizer was the Crispy Cuban Rolls, Crispy wrappers Filled with Slow roasted Pork, ham, Melted Swiss Cheese, Pickles and Mustard. That was tasty as well, however just a little burndt on the ends. Our third appetizer Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip, a blend of Crab, artichokes, and Cheese Served Warm with Grilled Bread.  That was Excellent!  Our group can make a meal off the Appetizers Menu alone. For my entree, I had the Pasta Carbonara. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. I always order that, because it is ALWAYS Epic!!!!  I just love it. The shrimp that's added is perfection and the noodles are done just the way I like it.   The gals loved their entrees as well. Whoops...forgot to mention we had a couple of bottle of Pinot Grigio. Lol. For dessert, I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake which was so elegant. Thank god I didn't lick the plate clean. All the girls had different, various types of Cheesecake. After all, it is the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Our birthday celebratory dinner was perfect. CF did not waver at all. Excellence. Our waiter was a doll, so polite but not over the top.

Both times the wait was really long, longer than they had told us. We started off eating artichoke and crab dip and sipping on mixed drinks at the bar while waiting, which were all good. Avocado eggrolls weren't bad either. Got the pineapple mojito which was pretty strong for a mixed drink. The pasta I had was good as well, not particularly memorable. The second time I came to buy a pumpkin cheesecake, I had called ahead of time to ask about pricing and whether an order had to be placed ahead of time, so I wouldn't have to wait.

My husband called them to order Louisiana chicken pasta and plain cheesecake, but they put him on hold for 10 minutes and the phone got disconnected. So he called back and he was on hold again for a few minutes until someone finally took his order and told him that it will be ready in 20-25 minutes.  After 20 minutes I went to pick up our order. Waited in line for 5 minutes while they were attending another customer whose order was incorrect. Finally, I gave them my name and order but they couldn't find it in their system. I don't know if it was the cashier or manager told me that this never happened to them I must have called the wrong place. Basically, they tried to put the blame on us for their mistake. Luckily my husband send me the screen shot of the call to hillsdale Cheesecake Factory. And she says, ""oh, that's weird maybe he didn't complete the order because it takes more than 5 minutes to place an order."" Are you kidding me!? We order only 2 items, why would it take more than 5 minutes to place a simple order!  Thus, I had to reorder my food. To make up for their mistake, which she didn't accept, she offered to give the cheesecake slice for free and said she will rush the order to 10 minutes. After 15 minutes I go to her asking about my order and she rudely tells me that ""well it's pasta, it takes time"" and walks away. After another 10 minutes they finally call my name  BUT it's only the pasta. When I asked that employee, he had no idea about the cheesecake slice so I had to reexplain the situation.  It really is not about the money. Was 6-$7 piece of cheesecake worth my time and frustration?  Lack of communication, disorganized management, and careless attitude of the female employee was shocking. I have been to many Cheesecake Factory's and by far I have had horrible experience in hillsdale one whether if it was dinning in or taking out several times.

Yet, the man who sat us gave us 5 adult menus. He even placed the adult menu in front of each person including the kids. Uhhhhh okayyyy. We had to ask for a Kids Menu from our Waitress and she too was surprised we didn't have any. It took 37 minutes to get our main dishes. I always order the Shrimp Scampi at every Cheesecake Factory chain , so I know exactly what it's supposed to taste like. The dish tonight however was so watered down and bland it was uneatable. I asked for the thai lettuce wraps to be boxed since it was BARELY touched. Because it took so long for the food we got full off the complimentary bread. The waitress boxes the food and places it in bags ready to go. It wasn't until the next day that I checked all the food. Why wouldn't you pack all 3 sauces for the lettuce wrap dish when it's part of the dish?? It was barely touched. That to me, means laziness. The dish looked almost untouched yet she forgot to pack all 3 sauces? How can you forget when the sauces are in the middle of the dish?? Yeah. No. I wasn't happy with the service at this location.

Oh right... the line, long wait during peak times and sometimes the service.  I come to this location multiple times a month. Sometimes the meal goes by smooth and wonderful and other times there would be a deafening fire alarm, service charging 3x the tip that I wrote which the manager compensated with a gift card however that said gift card had $0 when I tried to use it, taking over 10 minutes for missing lettuce and the list goes on.  However every time the food really shines. I love their Miso Salmon, Thai Salmon, Fresh Basil and Tomato and Flatbread, Wild Mushroom Soup, Fresh Kale Salad, Pasta, Shepard's Pie and lunch portioned items! It doesn't hurt they also offer a Skinnylicious Menu since most of their dishes are quite excessive in terms of fat and calories.  I have to admit I'm not much of a cake person. I rarely ever eat cake or cheesecake for that matter. However if I really had to eat a cheesecake then I enjoy their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It's one of the few that isn't overly drenched in chocolate and has a very yummy vanilla flavor.

Jennifer N.,"San Mateo, CA",645,299,1718,4.0,8/22/2016,"I don't normally enjoy restaurants that are chained to the point of identical with no uniqueness to them. But there's something about cheesecake factories and their incredible power to siphon though every mall in America and make its mark with their American sized dishes and not so interesting menu.  That said, the Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo is nice, and a popular place for shoppers. I really enjoy their hibachi steak. It is steak with beautiful flavors of mushroom and onions, sweetish with an Asian taste. The mashed potatoes are seriously indulgent and goes really well with the drippings of sauce that's laid on the beef. The meatloaf is also quite nice, and complex. The flavors are tangy and meaty, just what I would expect meatloaf to taste like.  I think most people really like the sides. Cheesecake Factory does not go wrong with their sides. There is a certain level of standard when it comes to chain restaurants and this is probably the only thing that's worth mentioning. Consistency has always been on point. The service though, that's another story. They seem to love to under employ and many of the waiters/waitresses are too busy and make no eye contact. My waitress also forgot the asparagus that came with my hibachi steak and when asked she was so sure it didn't come with it though it was stated on the menu. She said it was really weird that it said that on the menu, but I've been there a few times this year and had the same thing. Nothing has changed.

Seeing that the tables were small, we asked if there was any way we could sit in a booth (we had a baby with us and it would have been easier). Michael, tried to accommodate our hungry group and right when we were about to sit down Prince (the Indian server) came to our group and rudely stated that we couldn't sit there. He was insensitive to the fact that we had a baby with us and empty booths all around. There is a way to talk to people and the way that Prince came at us was really unacceptable. We told Prince that Michael said it was okay and then Michael just denied it. Really?! Seven people heard you say it was okay, Michael. We are paying customers that just wanted to sit and have some food. There was absolutely no need for the attitude.  After that, we were desperate and decided to squeeze into the high table.

I just wanted a refund on the wraps. Eventually I gave up because it was 10:30 at night!! Some of the worst costumer service I've ever dealt with, not going ever again.

They have a large large menu, anyone can definitely find something here. In fact, they might have TOO many things! You get lost in the menu. it always takes me forever to pick something, but whatever I pick is usually good. Sometimes the food is veryyyy salty. And I like salt. Whenever I eat here, I always have to drink 3 full glasses of water at least with the food because it's  so salty! But it's also really good. The portions are quite large as well. My favorite part? The bread! and Cheesecake! They bread is sooo good, the brown bread is deliciously sweet. The cheesecake, well, it's called the cheesecake factory! The service, is iffy. I've been at this location a few times and sometimes I get a great server and sometimes I don't. It really is up in the air.  The place is clean.. but not immaculate. But It's safe.

Mark O.,"San Francisco, CA",112,54,3,1.0,5/8/2016,"Went here for mother's day and had the worst experience in a long time. The reason for this review is an incredibly rude waitress named ""danielle/daniella"" if I recall correctly and while the manager did a great job in trying to right the situation, I don't think he understood how rude one of his staff members were. Here is a brief run down of what happened (I will shorten ""Danielle"" to D for the sake of brevity): 1) D starts off normally, we were all smiles and excited to eat after a long wait, which is normal at the factory. She takes our order, leaves and all seems well. Cool!  2) Comes back after a bit and says, ""What did you order? I forgot."" Okay, no problem! I repeated my order and said it's totally cool thanks for clarifying.  3) We ordered 2 drinks, one hot coffee and one iced coffee. She brings two iced coffees. We say, ""sorry but we ordered a hot coffee and an iced coffee"". She doesn't say anything and just takes the wrong order back. She seemed angry about her own error and me being anti-confrontational, I apologized to her when she came back since she had to go through getting the right order. ""D"" ignored this. Furthermore, we actually felt bad to ask, but she forgot cream and sugar so we asked for that too. At this point she seemed to be losing patience. She asks, ""You two want MILK or CREAM?"" we were like ""ermm I guess both?"" I mean, we must be pampered brats if we want cream and sugar with our coffees right?  4) She comes back with even more simmering frustration and drops the creams without a word. She never offered water so I had to wait to flag her down just to ask for a couple of iced waters. I asked almost timidly at this point b/c Im assuming she's having a REALLY bad day and I'm trying to give her a pass. She responds, ""I'll get to you"" in an angry tone. At this point we are really questioning why D is so dismissive and angry at a mere request for water. She could have just said, ""sure"" and I wouldn't have thought twice about it. Instead it was more like, ""leave me alone, how dare you make me correct my orders and NOW YOU are asking for waters TOO?""  5) D waitress comes back with, surprise, only 1 water. She is teaching us a lesson that we were acting spoiled when we wanted creme and sugar with coffee. Now we need to make do with only 1 cup of water. She drops it off again without eye contact or saying a word. I'm still trying to be nice and said, ""Thank you, I appreciate it"" and this is met by a stonewall of silence and D walking away. Now we are moving from timid confusion into full fledged indignant anger at paying to be treated like an unwanted vagrant in this fine fine establishment that manufactures cheesecakes.  6) Manager comes in at our request and was very apologetic and polite. However, it seemed like he was just saying sorry in general and didn't really acknowledge how poorly Miss ""D"" was treating us. He offered a glass of wine which we refused but appreciated as a gesture and said he will have a chat with ""D"". He did a good job based on how steamed we finally got at that point so he (I think his name was Chris?) has no bearing on this negative review. We appreciate him trying to make things right. Conclusion: ""Danielle or Daniella"" was such a rude, resentful, and angry waitress that we are never coming to this branch again, despite our general favorable opinion of Cheesecake factories in general. If this particular waitress is fired, hopefully nobody will go through such a random episode of poor treatment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=160

Third, the shrimp was de-veined but clearly the black disgusting threadlike intestinal tract was on all the shrimp (check out the picture I took). Fourth, the shrimp was overcooked and had a rubbery consistency to it. I told the waiter and all she could do was say ""I'm sorry about that."" She was nice enough to grab more sauce to add to the pasta. The best thing about this meal was the bread and butter they serve at the beginning. Never coming back to this place again.

They said that the party seated at the table designated for us had already paid and they were just waiting to clean it up. Another 20 minutes passed, so we went to go check again and Michelle gave us the run around, saying that people were ahead of us when in reality, we were there the longest. Just before that, they said that we already had a table. All of a sudden, we don't?! We waited another 10 minutes, all the while Michelle is talking about us to another employee with us within earshot. Disrespectful. Another employee came and asked if we have been helped and we told him not really because Michelle was of no help. Within a minute, we were seated.

And then we ordered a crispy chicken costolleta and a chicken sandwich without cheese. The waiter got the sandwich with the cheese and we had to send it back. They then just scraped off the cheese, turned it upside down and gave it back. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery and we traded it for a fish taco. The taco was laced with barbecue sauce and didn't go well with it. As for the crispy chicken costolleta, it was just breaded chicken with a lot of butter and some lumpy mashed potatoes. Oh and before I forget, I had to ask for a knife for my dish because there wasn't one on the table. By now I was done and just wanted to leave, but decided to get the fudge cake to feel better.

They then apologized for their mistake.. But by the time we got there, it was just a mess. We got forks .. But no plates. Drinks but no water, even after requesting it. Flagging down a waiter was hard enough too.  I overall really liked our server though. He was a very sweet guy. However this experience was just ridiculous.

Ranjan P.,"San Francisco, CA",3,335,22,4.0,6/3/2017,"This was the closest place and we're starving, we popped in here for a late lunch. To be totally honest, my expectations were low, after all, it's considered a teflon, right? Three of us are seated fairly promptly, and we order lemon cheesecake, a lunch special small pizza and caesar salad, plus a Thai chicken curry over rice dish, which my husband and mother in law shared. First of all, the bread was remarkable: piping warm, crusty and soft (two types) with butter. The food was uniformly very good, the caesar sparkled, fresh and crisp romaine with a tangy dressing, which did not overwhelm (I did miss the anchovies, though maybe I should've asked for them). The pizza was more than decent, a crispy and blistered crust, blend of sausage and pepperoni, kalamata olives on request, a piquant tomato sauce. My husband scarfed down his rice dish and their tropical fresh brew iced tea for fantastic, fruity and not at all bitter without being cloyingly sweet. Here's my only negative: the cheesecake was disgusting--shocker, right? After all, they're named ""Cheesecake Factory!"" I'm chagrined to admit that after one teeny bite, I sent it back because no way was I gonna be able to eat it--it was inedible: the consistency was not light, airy, and fluffy; nor was it tangy and fresh lemony. Instead, it was a dense and artificially tasting, cream laden gunk of a bloby thing, gross . . . maybe the worst cake I've ever eaten. the food made up for it though. And here's the awesome part: every single person who served us was sweet, attentive, caring, warm, friendly, and super helpful! The guy who seated us offered to turn down the music, because it was blaringly loud for my aging ears. Our server was an incredibly kind young woman, who listened more than beyond the call of duty to my description of the cheesecake. As we were walking out, two different employees said goodbye in the sweetest and sincere way possible.

Jin K.,"New York, NY",108,14,107,4.0,5/25/2015,"I'm visiting SF and since there is no Cheesecake Factory on the Big Island, I had to stop by.  The food, I would say, wasn't that amazing (everything seemed to be quite buttery or oily), but the cheesecakes were fantastic. I definitely want to stop by again before I head back to Hawaii, not for food, but for desserts.  Our waiter, Justin, was friendly. Though, he did mess up one of our orders (brought out the wrong pasta). But overall, he was one of the nicest waiters I met. I went with my parents and some of their friends who couldn't speak English very well, but he was very attentive and he tried his best to meet our needs. It's always nice to walk out of a restaurant, knowing that if my parents were to come again on their own (without a person who can speak English fluently), that they would still be treated the same as others.

I took the plate and cheesecake to the dessert counter and asked them to cut it.  Those staff members were very nice and helpful. We only tipped our miserable server 15% Table was sticky, we complained, server sent over a nice guy that had no idea how to clean a table.

After about 25 min we realized that we were not going to get the appetizer and because 10 minutes later out came our lunch. At that time I told the waiter to remove it from our bill. The food was okay, I wouldn't say it was great. Upon leaving we purchased 2 salad dressing jars that were in the front display, however we quickly learned they treated this sale like a ""to go"" order. We waited for over 20 minutes, yes 20 minutes before the kid behind the counter went to check on the order for us, he even said it was taking to long. When we did finally get our dressing the jars were not labeled like the one in the front  display and were wet with water (assuming they had to rinse the dressing off that spilled).

Tatiana D.,"Downey, CA",53,27,11,1.0,6/14/2015,"Terrible experience. First off I  want to say that this restaurant has the worst management I have ever encountered. I get there and the girl in the front tells me to hold on for a few mins to see how long the wait will be, I probably waited five mins just for her to tell me the wait time would be 30-35 mins ok no big deal. Mind you there was maybe another party waiting so I believed we came at the perfect time. Five minutes later we started seeing a lot of families coming in one after another parties with the same amount of people as us seven. I decide to go to the mall and have my mom dad and sister wait, it's been 45 mins since my check in and when I come back my family is still waiting. They tell me they've asked and nothing has happened. I talk to the girl who originally signed me in to see what was going on she tells me that a table is getting ready and they're just cleaning it up and that it will be a few mins. We waited 20 more minutes and still no call. I go up to another girl working the front and tell her I'm upset that it's taking so long and that a few mins turned into 20 mins she tells me that the table is being cleaned AGAIN by this time I'm very irate and ask to speak to the manager. Chris the worst manager I have ever met in my entire life. He was extremely unprofessional, rude and egotistical. I approach him to let him know he tells me my table is being cleaned which apparently is their cope out for any waiting customer and this is pretty standard from what I can see. I tell him I didn't want this to turn into another 20 mins after all we did travel two hours just to come here. He never apologizes or even tries to make eye contact with me and stares at the computer screen the whole time. He says to me "" well I can check but I'll be walking away from you"" like.... I really cared for his company go check!!!! I wait by the waiting area after he told me to give him ""five"" minutes and to my disbelief he never goes to check on the table like he said he would. I time him. After 5 mins I went up to him and told him that it had been five minutes he sighs as if I was bothering him and proceeds to tell me to get my family and wait on the side when they finally sit us.  I don't know what was worse the manager or the super burnt meatloaf they tried to hide from me by flipping the meat over. Thankfully I took a picture so you guys could see. The waiter apologized and removed the plate and said he would involve the ""manager"" I told him it was fine to just let it go... You would assume someone would still come to your table and apologize but no.... Which was not surprising.  Needless to say I have never said that the Cheesecake Factory has great service since I've been to many different ones but this one definitely took the award for being the worst.

Denise L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3230,523,3736,2.0,10/7/2012,"A definite meh. After an evening of go-karting, we were all very excited this Cheesecake Factory was open late. Our excitement was met with last-string, very unenthusiastic waiters. I understand being tired and not wanting to serve a large group, but you can't let it show. The food was good as always, but the service was extremely disappointing. Let me give you a few examples. 1. My friend ordered the regular banana milkshake, specifically requesting the one with NO alcohol. He doesn't really like the taste of alcohol, so he wouldn't want one in a delicious milkshake, right? So what happens? His milkshake arrives, full of alcohol. When he informed the waiter of the mixup, she acted completely put out, like it was his fault for not being an alcoholic on the fly. 2. The ahi tuna tartare was not available. This was unfortunate as I had been really craving some. The waiter came back and told me they were out, but didn't offer a replacement suggestion or any other information. She just stood there. Finally I picked up a menu and randomly chose something else. 3. The credit card processing took freakin' FOREVER. When we looked over at the cash register to see what was taking so long, we saw the waiters standing around chatting and laughing, while our waiter held our bill in her hand. On the bright side, I discovered a few winners on the menu: - Spinach Artichoke Dip - Cheesy perfection atop tortilla chips. - Mini Sliders - Surprisingly delicious and a good-sized portion. - Papas Bravas - Crispy and tasty. - Asian Pear Martini - Wow! My friend ordered this and I had a sip. Then a few more because I had to make sure it was good. ;) The asian pear flavor is subtle and blended so well with the martini itself. My new favorite Cheesecake Factory cocktail. The tiramisu cheesecake was flawless, as always. TIP: Don't come here for late-night fun. You'll get the last-string waiters who really don't care. TIP2: You don't have to feel guilty about eating so much cheesecake! Order to go, eating several bites at the restaurant and the remaining portion at home. It keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days after purchase. Oh, guilt-free pleasure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=280

They all the look the same, sell the same, and act the same. Our server at this particular location was very nice, expeditious, and knew exactly when to check in on us.  The food is good, but not out of this world - well except for the 10,000 calorie miso salmon that I just never have the guts to order! I ordered my full meal from the skinnylicious menu (brilliant idea btw). I had a margarita and the turkey burger, hubs had the herb crusted salmon, and baby had the kids chicken quesadilla.  The turkey burger was great. It had melt in your mouth onion and mushrooms. The salad it came with was lightly dressed and very generous ($10.95). The margarita on the other hand was mostly ice and not much Rita! I literally drank the entire think in 3 sips ($10$)!   My hubby had the Huen crusted salmon. The word crusted makes it sound like the outer part of the fish will be crisp but it actually isn't. It's very soft and has potential to be very delicious. I feel like it was missing seasoning and a acid in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was good but needed that little push to make me crave it next time ($17.95).  My LO ordered the quesadilla. It was huge. She loved it! What's not to love? Flour tortilla, lotsa cheese, and wee bits of chicken ($6.95). The kids meal also comes with a free drink.  All in all we love Cheesecake Factory.

Matt G.,"San Francisco, CA",2163,1911,3825,3.0,6/20/2012,"Joe Cool and his daughter came here for an early Father's Day dinner after walking around the air-conditioned Hillsdale Shopping mall.  The one-year-old Cheesecake Factory is located on the street side of the Hillsdale Shopping Mall. Just like all the CF locations, I like the dark ambience with a lounge-like feel.  Since we were here on Father's Day, the wait for an actual table was a ridiculous 45 minutes. However, I did see the empty bar with the NBA Championship game being televised. So we ran over there quickly sat at the stools to watch and enjoy the game for our dinner...we, as in, my daughter and I...at the bar, folks! Most of the restaurants give huge portions. So my daughter split a dinner-portion Caesar salad for $9.00 and a big appetizer dish of Buffalo Chicken Tenders for $13.50. The Caesar salad wasn't bad, but very hearty. But the Chicken Tenders, with the dipping sauces of Honey Dijon and ranch sauce and Mexican-style corn, was decent and nothing too stunning.  Salad:    Chicken Tenders:  Since we took the train to San Mateo, I opted to try one of the restaurant's patented cocktails: the Blueberry Mojito. The $12.00 cocktail had mint leaves, lime wedges, fresh blueberries muddled up in a glass. Then fresh Blueberry puree, huge shots of Blueberry Stoli vodka and rum. All combine in one tall glass. This is a very refreshing drink and tasted good while watching the basketball game. Cocktail:  We did take home a slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake for $10.00. The sweet treat was good (sorry, no pictures).  Just like many of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants we have visited, some of the foods are good. And some are bad.

They have a pretty large menu with an assortment of different foods - salad, tacos, burgers, pasta, etc. Kind of like a BJ's but replace the pazookies with cheesecake.

Nothing is particularly tasty, though nothing is really bad either. Just OK food.  Unfortunately almost every time I've ordered pasta, the noodles come out lukewarm or cold. Why??

He simply said ""I'm not a cashier"" and turned around and walked away before I could ask him where I could go to order. I stood there for about 5 more minutes but neither one of the two people behind the counter turned around at all. I walked away and the person who walked up after me looked to be in the conundrum. I walked over to the hostess stand to ask where I could place an order but she was taking a very long time checking people in and she looked annoyed as each person walked up..

Nicholas H.,"San Francisco, CA",199,78,26,1.0,5/16/2016,"Superlative - a word that means of the highest quality, supreme or above all; a word that does not apply to Cheesecake Factory. I came in with my family the day before Mother's day. I have always been dubious of the Cheesecake Factory, but this visit will be my last.  SERVICE 1/5: We were served by a gentleman with glasses. Not so sure what his name was, but if he is reading this review, he will know. When we first sat down, we already notice that a set of utensils were missing - I asked the waiter and he quickly forgot about it. He would disappear for long periods of time without checking up on us. Whenever we had our waters refilled, received bread or butter, it was only because we asked him to. I understand that that the restaurant was busy, so that was not the biggest issue.  FOOD 1/5: If it were possible to give 0 stars, it would have definitely happened here. I ordered the fish and chips lunch, while my SO ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries. When the dishes came, the dishes looked fine. However, after taking a bite of the fish, it was the exact opposite of fine. I am not even sure what I ate till this day - the fish tasted very off. I would rather order a filet-o-fish from McDonald's at this point. The biggest issue was the sweet potato fries. We told our consistently absent waiter that the sweet potato fries were both cold and soggy, a very bad combo for sweet potato fries. He didn't apologize for the quality of the food and disappeared for another 15 minutes. When he came back, he gave us the SAME order + more of the cold fries.

Tomas P.,"San Carlos, CA",76,340,71,4.0,1/24/2017,I've had good experiences with the service here! The food is just what you'd expect from a Cheesecake Factory: great quality at reasonable prices. Unfortunately the biggest problem was when a table next to us asked their bill to be split 9 ways. The server had to follow their request but that slowed everything else down for 15-20 minutes. If Cheesecake Factory has no rules against a request like that then they should also be ready to backfill whenever an unreasonable request like that comes up. Instead it just made the experience worse for other patrons.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=80
Ta S.,"San Mateo, CA",96,41,55,1.0,1/7/2017,"I love this place. But recently when I've ordered take out, they seem to take forever with it.

I don't usually leave my house until 15-20 mins after and then drive over which takes about another 5 minutes. When I get there I pay and then stand around for another 20 mins. They need more structure at the take out register. All I ordered was 2 slices of cheesecake. I called in my order at 9:45 and didn't get my 2 slices until 10:30!

The brown and sourdough bread were both good, though the brown bread was a tad bit sweeter than usual. I also ordered a virgin Pina Colada (no dairy - yay!). It was strictly ok since it was waaay sweeter than it's been in the past - 2.5/5 The Avocado Toast was 3.5/5 - nice texture, not too creamy and the pickled onions added a nice taste. The radish also complemented the watercress. Could have done without the tomatoes and could do with a just a pinch of red pepper flakes perhaps California Guacamole Salad 4/5 - leaves were crisp, dressing was just enough and not too oily.

I checked this time to make sure that the cake did not have whip on it - it didn't. But, when I came back home, I realize there was no extra sauce with the pasta - and to make things worse the person who took my order probably imagined that I wanted all the sauce on the side. So there was literally no sauce it the pasta, it was sautéed without sauce. I tried calling back and speaking to the manager, but after getting hung up on twice, I gave up on it.

By this time, 35 minutes passed we finally get water...15 mins later our waiter comes back over to tell us ""somebody deleted your order"" uhm. NO. we CLEARLY SAW YOU TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE at the booth in front of us AND LAUGHING with them AND WHAT NOT--- NEVER PUT IN OUR DAMN ORDER. 5) 1 hour later, we finally get our food....by another waitress who happened to serve us most of the night and the other waiter comes by once to see if we're okay. I hope the tip we left was given to the nice waitress who helped us throughout the night.

Joe C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,15,,3.0,10/16/2016,"Let me start by saying that overall I love the food here.  I was tempted to give this place 4 stars but decided against it for 2 reasons.  1) Even though, for the most part, the food here is awesome, there is an inconsistency.  Both with the preparation of the dish and the overall flavor.  Sometimes i find my food a bit overcooked and dry while other times it has way to much sauce.  Sometimes the flavor is right on while other times the sauce tastes bland and flavorless.   2) The service has been progressively getting worse.  The wait time is never to bad, but once you have sat down and ordered it can be quite a while before you get your order.  On occasions, we have been sat at a table without linens or silverware and had to remind our waiter several times before having it brought to us.

At first I was irritated but as I observed him handing people reserving tables AND handling the ones who's buzzer rang I had to give him props. Not one time did he look overwhelmed, he greeted everyone with a smile...even the grouchy ones. We waited about an hour and he remembered our name with ease. He told my partner how short staffed they were and apologized for the slow service.  Our server was sooo sweet and was really attentive. Food: my food was nasty, I usually order the Louisiana pasta but choose the spicy cashew chicken instead, and who ever cooked it thought they were slick turning all the chicken around so the burnt side would be at the bottom.

I ask for no onions but of course I got onions, no one pays attention. I have a chunk of onions, tomato, pickles and shredded cabbage (?). No mayo n special sauce on the side. I got mayo!! I ordered a burger ( shredded raw cabbage instead of a lettuce). Was a bit confused, was I suppose to make my own coleslaw for the burger. I ask for well done I got medium. Raw in the middle. OFreakenMG!! Not done yet.  Our server's name is Reid. He offered a salad to go cuz the fries never made it, "" they're still growing the potato"". It's spring lettuce mixed n dressing on the side. Are you F'en kidding me!! Nothing else is in the salad but mix lettuce. Got it, I'll go to Trader Joe's for cherry tomatoes, croutons, cucumber, corn and cottage cheese.    My colleague order spaghetti w/ meatballs, his comment was "" bet if I threw this meatball across, the glass wall, will shatter"". The fork slides down, overcooked, hard as a rock!    Best advice, I can give Reid. Either learn the restaurant product or quit.  If I have to pay $79.82 + tip. Shouldn't I get a decent meal.

Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1547,2069,30611,3.0,8/28/2014,"Not sure why I'm able to say this, but somehow tonight was my first visit ever to a Cheesecake Factory.  Overall, I was pretty impressed. There were some hiccups with the service, but some nice rebounding by the staff smoothed things over. A soup I ordered never showed up, but it eventually came out at no charge. That was nice. Salad dressings ordered on the side with two entree salads didn't come out with the salads, they came 5 minutes later. And my son's toast was very oddly toasted - golden and toasty one one side and white as a New England snowfall on the other. But the good points of our visit here were very good indeed. The opening bread basket  (light and dark loaves) was terrific. The menu is gargantuan, and CF gets bonus points for having such a varied menu including a lot of calorie friendly Skinnylicious choices. And then of course, there are the desserts.   I had a cup of the tardy Enchilada Soup and it was terrific- chockful of tomatoes and cheese and tortilla strips. I had a Skinnylicious Chopped Salad with blue cheese and chicken- it was great and pretty darned big. We had three slices of cheesecake -a blueberry/white chocolate, an outrageous chocolate, and Snickers. Yes- they were fabulous. Our server was wonderful, polite, courteous, and quick to remove the soup from our bill. That was a classy move. Our dinner with desserts ran $70 and we felt that it was a great value since we hauled a lot of the meal home for midnight snacks. In summary, it took me a long time to get into a Cheesecake Factory, and it is clearly A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=180

I always try to avoid one server. I won't name names on my review, but this person does not seem to have a good reputation. I usually request to not have her serve me, and it seems as though some hosts have given me a look of agreement.  I can't blame the chefs for anything, because food is pretty good, but I am not coming back here unless something miraculous happens with the rest of the staff.

I want to review this place from an unbiased point of view, but I fear that the experience I had will make it difficult. Our visit came on June 23, 2015 at roughly around 6:30 p.m. When we asked one of the three hostesses at the front how long it would take, she told us it would be approximately 25 mins. Not a terrible wait time considering it's around dinner time, even if it is a Tuesday. We decided to wait and the hostess have us our little pager.  While we were waiting, one thing we observed was that the hostesses weren't using the pager to notify people that it was their turn to be seated. Approximately 45 mins passed before my wife decided to ask one of the three hostesses how much longer we'd have to wait. The hostess told us less than five mins. By this point my son was getting really hungry. Another 10 mins and 15 people getting seated passed before my wife had to once again inquire how much longer it would take to be seated. The hostess callously states to her, ""In a minute."" We were finally shown to our seats without a single apology for the wait time and when we got there, the entire row was empty...seriously? I understand that this restaurant my be short staffed, but almost an hour of waiting and you have literally 11 tables all empty?  The saving grace was that our waiter was pretty nice. He came by often to check on us and refill our waters. But he was the only good thing about this experience.The food was bland and dry, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a day. I think ballpark food is handled with better care than a place like the Cheesecake Factory. How do you mess up pasta? The Cuban wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.

Jennifer R.,"Oakville, Canada",27,133,43,3.0,10/19/2015,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to a few locations in the area, all with great food, but am giving this location three stars based on service.  Our server was very friendly, but he always seemed to be standing near the bar chatting with the other servers. He rarely came around or asked if we needed anything, so I was left to go to the bar myself twice. Once to ask for ketchup and once to get drink refills. He never apologized when he saw me standing at the bar and didn't make a point of coming around to see how we were doing after. Disappointing since even at the most busy locations such as downtown SF, I have always had superb service. The guac is my favourite thing ever. It is made to order just the way you like it. It's not packed too full of ""stuff"", so you can actually taste the extremely fresh avocado. Chips are great too, never stale. It is always a must when I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.  This time I had their cheeseburger. The thing is HUGE! I could only make it through half and took the other half to go. It hasn't been frozen and is cooked just the way you like it - I ordered mine medium rare and it was perfect. I got mine with a side Caesar salad which was also good.  The bread was brought to the table right away and our drink orders were taken soon after we sat down. No issues there.  The hostess could have been more friendly. We went during lunch and had to wait about 20 minutes. No smile, no real greeting, just a straight to the point number. It wasn't a deal breaker, but not what I'm used to. This particular location is in the Hillsdale Shopping Mall making it very busy on a regular basis. There is lots of parking close by and they offer curbside pick-up which I think is great.

Originally the plan was to eat sushi in downtown San Mateo, but my boyfriend and I went on a Friday night and there was WAY too many cars fighting for parking so we decided to come here instead as I was ready to give this place another try.  Coming here on a Friday night around 8pm was a bad idea. The wait time (according to the hostess..) was about 50 minutes for 2 people. Fine. I was hungry and unwilling to drive anywhere so we just put our name down and got the buzzer.. thing. The hostess did inform us that the bar area and the high tables next to it were first come first serve meaning that if a table opens up... run to it. Run like the wind, Bullseye! It took us about 20 minutes for a high table to open up and when it did... we walked super fast to it.  Service... took a while. We sat at the table with the last group's mess for a while watching server after server walk by us for about 10 minutes before a server actually took notice of us and began clearing the table. The server my boyfriend and I got was very friendly and brought the drinks and food to our table as swiftly as possible.  Food wise... eh. My boyfriend's shepard's pie was yum, but my basil tomato pasta was a let down. The penne in my dish was still a little hard to chew and all I really tasted was the tomato sauce. No basil whatsoever. And I don't know if it's just the way it's suppose to be, but the sauce was super watered down. And there was oil floating around in my dish as well. (Go see my photo~) I didn't even want to take it home, but I would feel too bad for wasting food so I'll try to stomach it down later. Overall, eh. Service was good, but the food was just so-so.

elena d.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,1,2.0,3/24/2016,I have to agree with another feedback about service and food quality inconsistency. It's almost every time something is wrong with food or order. Today my sons chicken strips smelled like calamari !!! And he hates Seafood. By the time they made another portion my son was staffed on bread and sleepy to eat anything. I usually order Tuscan chicken and once I had a raw chicken served ! Yum... Not! Fries is often over salted. Service is super slow. I like some dishes but every time I come I feel some sort of disappointment and wonder was the visit worth the price we end up paying?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=220
Matt C.,"San Mateo, CA",174,12,4,2.0,2/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory's menu needs an agent and a publisher. It's biblical in girth. So you would think that in all of those pages, you could find something you'd actually want to order. Some signature dish. Some reason this restaurant exists. But guess what? Not really.  The food is perfectly, completely fine. Just fine. Not a review any chef will ever tack to his wall and celebrate.  Maybe it's because the menu lacks anything approaching originality and the selections are equally overpriced. It is interchangeable with The Elephant Bar, in fact, another restaurant without any recognizable style or take on cuisine. They both delight in serving acceptable food in atmospheric environments. Good. Great. That's enough for some people. And I have come back to The Cheesecake Factory several times because it's tucked inside the Hillsdale Mall and therefore conveniently located when I'm shopping with the family. But I won't be going back any time soon.  Let me paint you the picture of my final visit. It's noon on a Wednesday. The restaurant isn't yet crowded -- it will be; I'm convinced San Mateo's residents never eat at home -- and even so, my huge, untenable party of three must sit and wait for fifteen minutes while the staff prepare our table. Or continue Snapchatting. Whatever it is they're doing while they avoid customers. Our waiter is an inattentive millennial with black tribal earring plugs and a myriad of tattoos. He graces our table just once in 60 minutes; never stops by to refill water or soda, to let us know why the appetizers we ordered haven't come out, to ask if we need anything, or even to flip us the bird. He is a millennial phantom, disappearing into the ether along with our order.  About 30 minutes in, no appetizers delivered, I bet my wife that all of our food will show up together. 20 minutes later, it does. Except, half of our items are missing, including lunch for our six-year-old son. I can't even complain to our original waiter because he never returns; rather, he dispatches another waiter to deliver our food. When I inform her of our situation, she goes to fetch him, at which point he materializes one last time, says he'll remove some of the undelivered items from our bill, and then vanishes again without a hint of an apology. Not fine dining. Just ""fine"" food served by distracted doofuses. This franchise ain't special to begin with, and this location is especially stupid. Don't support it. Instead, drive to downtown San Mateo and walk around. The city has emerged as one of the best on the peninsula for great restaurants, particularly if you like Asian or Asian fusion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=220

No reservations and long waits for no apparent reason.  I was in charge of organizing a get together dinner for work (11 people). They do not take reservations, so I made sure to drive earlier and get a table for 5:30pm. I arrive at 5pm to have my name on. They tell me by 5:30 it should be ready. I'm fine with that. But the puzzling look I have was that there was plenty of tables available and still had to wait ... Well good thing I came early! We get seated at around 5:45. Our server took a while to get us our bread/drinks. I could only imagine the waiting because the place was starting to get packed and he was managing other tables. Between our bread, drinks, refills, entrees and dessert, it was pretty long. About 30 minutes every interval.  Their pasta dishes is a hefty size and delicious, too! Not sure about their other entrees because my coworkers weren't too excited about it. Price was a bit on the expensive side.  To sum it up, pasta was GREAT! Others, not so sure.

Jacky C.,"San Mateo, CA",119,125,109,2.0,6/4/2015,"This place can be a hit or miss, and this depends on your server and what time you decide to dine here. There were times where the servers were attentive and the meal went smoothly, and there were times where we were neglected and it took an insane amount of time for our food to come out (compound that with an 1.5 hour waittime) which made the experience horrible. A friend ordered chicken with their pasta(cost extra) and they forgot to put it into the dish. After inquiring about it, it took an extra 20 minutes for them to bring it out. it might have just been an off day, but somethings are inexcusable.  The total meal time took over 3 hours(from waittime till the end of the meal) which wasted a huge portion of our time. However, The portions on the food are pretty decent and the cheesecakes are delicious, but for the price of everything, it might be better to choose a different restaurant for a better dining experience.  I have also experienced their happy hour. The appetizers averaged $5.50 and the portions were good.  The drinks however were really watered down. The tuna tartare was good, but they gave very little. We also tried the Buffalo blast, crab and artichoke dip, and the happy hour burger. All were delicious but all greasy, so if you are a health nut, I might steer clear of this place. I would say I will eat here again, because I live close by.

The server did not charge us for the 2 items that were messed up on the order, which was so nice, but the staff at the front were ridiculous!

Ken C.,"San Mateo, CA",26,71,2,1.0,10/21/2015,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory locations and I have to say this is by far the worst.  The food isn't terrible, but it's not as good as the others.  For one, their Chicken Piccata is way too oily.  Their Steak Medallions are also over-seasoned.  Not to mention that each piece of steak is a different degree of doneness.  I ordered mine medium, but the pieces on the sides are well-done.  The ones closer in are medium-well, and only the center pieces are medium. But the food itself doesn't warrant a 1-star.  The service does though.  The waiters and waitresses are okay.  They do a fine job when the restaurant isn't busy.  What really ticks me off is their bakery counter, where people pick up their food to go.  Every time I order food, I always ask for wheat-bread only.  90% of the time, they either 1) give me both types or 2) don't give me any bread at all.  Also, 100% of the time, the bread will be smashed.  I don't know why they do this, but they always squeeze two pieces of bread together then wrap it in tin foil.  If I really wanted to eat panini bread, I would've asked for panini bread.  My latest trip there today was the same deal.  What's worse is that when I got there, the person at the counter said the wheat bread won't be ready for another 10 minutes.  I said I can wait, so I stood on the side.  15 minutes passed, no bread came out, and none of the people at the bakery section were doing anything.  They were just chatting and hanging out.  So I went up and asked them if my food is ready, and that's when they went to the kitchen and found out everything was already ready.  So basically if I didn't speak up, they wouldn't even check up on my food.  Yea, great service.  I wish I got her name so everyone can avoid her, but you know what. I think the whole bakery section is full of people like this, so it's best just to never buy take-out here. This Cheesecake Factory also seem a bit dirtier than the others, but it's nothing too deal breaking for me.

Cassy Y.,"South San Francisco, CA",248,52,25,2.0,9/29/2016,"One of the worst cheesecake factories I've tried. The biggest thing is the food, right? I ordered the smokehouse BBQ burger and it was layered in oil. The bun was super oily, the patty seemed like it would be tasteless without the bbq sauce, and overall I felt like my arteries were clogging after a bite or two. I don't expect to have a healthy meal here but I do expect the actually be able to enjoy my burger without feeling disgusted with the amount of oil.  To add to my dinning experience here, our waiter almost never checked up on us and we had a hard time flagging her down whenever we wanted more water or anything else.

Usually a 20-30 minute wait after being seated to get someone to take out order. We had to ask a waiter to take our order and after doing so she seemed bothered. All the staff does is sit around talking to each other and it's great that they like each other but they should like their job too maybe then they would actually do it.

After I paid, he proceeded to help the next customer. I had to ask again and where he then asked someone that get it. I asked for my cheesecake that I ordered and he said it's coming. He proceeded to two more customers and then just pulled a slice from the refrigerator behind him and put it on a bag and gave it to me. If that's all he needed to do then why didn't he do that in the first place. No reason for me to wait for three customers to order.

Peter R.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,30,20,3.0,8/10/2016,"I was planning on visiting the Hillsdale mall to purchase an item that only this mall had.  I contacted the Cheesecake Factory to see if they allow dogs to dine at the restaurant, this way I can plan my schedule ahead of time instead of searching around for restaurants that allow dogs.. Surprisingly, they said yes. Caresse, answered my call and advised me to contact them 1 hour ahead of time, this way they can guarantee me a seating as it gets busy sometimes.  I arrived, and the girl who looks stoned, with a nose piercing said, ""There is no seating for you as there are no servers.""  I walked out, and contacted the restaurant by phone to ask for Caresse, but another person picked up. A female named ""Andy"" picked up and stated that there is seating for us if we have dogs, but it will take about 15 minutes.  I did my shopping at the store nearby and thought ""15 minutes? I don't need to check in first..."" I did my shopping and went in to check and the stoned girl again said ""we don't have seats for patrons with dogs."" I advised her I called twice, once for Caresse and another time with Andy. She then said it'll take about 25 minutes to get us seated. I thought.. ok. 45 minutes later, I went up and asked her, ""What is taking so long?"" She advised me that there are tables that have been there for 3 hours... 3 HOURS! And she is not sure when they are leaving. So my 25 minute wait was going to 50 minutes soon. I asked if there is a way I could order to go, and she just told me ""not here, over there."" No compensation for time wasted or anything,  The manager, who was standing next to her at the time, then told me he will serve us himself as he felt bad we waited double the predicted time. He advised there were 4 call-outs on waiters/waitresses. I felt bad.  Honestly, I'm not an impatient person if you try to make things right... At the end, I felt good that the manager did serve us personally. However, I wasn't quite happy with the other staff in the restaurant.  I paid my share and tipped well since I felt bad for the manager having to deal with the stress of having unreliable staff... I know how you feel Chris.... I deal with unreliable personnel myself... Although I didn't get a discounted meal, I'll probably come back here... but not for a while.

I even asked for tons of grated Parmesan on top but the pasta itself was still incredibly flavorless. It wasn't creamy/cheesy-- isn't that what alfredo is supposed to be all about?  I was extremely disappointed.

Roderick T.,"Daly City, CA",23,32,353,2.0,1/8/2016,"I like the Cheesecake Factory.. this one in particular, not so much. Went here for dinner last Wednesday night, just to hang and grub with some of my family. I usually go to the one at Macy's in downtown SF, but this location was more convenient for everyone that night. It took a while for us to get seated, about 40 minutes or so. That was a bit annoying. I assumed there wouldn't be too many people out since it was a weekday. Perhaps folks are still on holiday. As we were seated, though, I noticed a lot of open tables. I'm thinking maybe they were understaffed that night. For the sake of brevity and comprehensiveness, I'll go through my qualms via bullet points. - Bread. First things first. Hook us up with dat bread doe! We got our drink orders in quickly enough, but didn't receive our basket of baguettes until our libations were ready. We need some of that light sustenance to keep the hunger pangs at bay! - Drink orders. One was wrong, plain and simple, another was way too sweet, and the wait time for all drinks to be served took longer than usual. My cousin ordered a margarita, and she was presented a mojito. All coo I guess since our waitress realized her mistake and got the correct order in. My sister, on the other hand ordered the strawberry lemonade, and she didn't receive it until well after the first two cocktails were delivered. Really? And to make matters worse, the beverage was entirely too sweet, even after diluting it with water. She eventually had to order a different drink midway through our meal. - Food. Overcooked, slightly burnt, and a little salty. My sister and girlfriend both got the Bistro shrimp pasta, and in both dishes, the shrimp were slightly overcooked and burnt. Normally the battered shrimp are golden brown crispy, but this time they were visibly darker brown (even in the dim lighting) and chewy. My girl also commented that the angel hair pasta tasted bland, and she had to constantly mix the plate in search of more flavor. I ordered the meatloaf dish, and found it to be a little heavy with salt. To be fair, it is a hearty dish, and the flavors are meant to be bold, but I was only able to eat one slice of three, and only a portion of the mashed potatoes and gravy. It made for excellent leftovers, though! My cousin ordered the Hibachi steak, and though it appeared burnt upon first inspection, it turned out to be fine. Again, the dim lighting didn't do any favors. 2 stars = ""Meh. I've experienced better."" The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant after all. This location is simply not my favorite. I prefer the one in downtown SF. Protip: Learn from our mistake! If you're in the mood for a sweet, non alcoholic beverage, try the frozen iced mango, if you don't mind slushy drinks. We used to get this all the time when we were younger. It's no longer served in the tall, slim glass of yesteryear, but it's the same tasty drink. Make it a strawberry or cranberry frozen iced mango if you want the added red swirls!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=120
Laura C.,"Novato, CA",1,10,10,1.0,2/27/2017,"Wow I RARELY leave yelp reviews because really all I care about is food.. Lol and this place has good food! However I would only recommend getting takeout. THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED EVER. I get that places can have off nights but based off the reviews it seems like this particular restaurant has a rude, lazy, poorly organized staff. I would describe them all but it would take me too long because there was not one employee in that restaurant that I would even consider hiring if I were an employer, so if you walk in wondering which ones are a*****les, it's all of them.   It started out with simple things such as not greeting us politely when we walked in, then our waiter would take 15-20 minutes at a time between checking on our table filling water and bringing our food. We pretty much had to flag him down or stare at him until he noticed us every time we needed something. He forgot one of our entrees and then completely disappeared 10 minutes later we finally flagged down another server who told us she would go get a manager, then a manager came and told us he would figure it out then left, then our server came back and told us he would bring out the order fresh but by that point everyone was done eating so we asked for a box and guess what they didn't box it, another random server brought out the dish and when we asked him to get a box he never came back with one.. it just kept getting progressively worse. We waited so long for our check we had to get up and again seek out a manager who told us he would find our server and then just never came back.. then our server messed up our check. Twice!!!!!!!! the worst part about this insensitive manager is that he just walked around carrying a drink in his hand (non alcoholic) talking to the other employees who all looked like they didn't give a f**k about their job. It still took another 15 20 minutes to get out of that place and I have never been so disappointed by restaurant staff in my life.

Drew L.,"Arlington, VA",5,1,,1.0,12/30/2014,"This was literally the worst service I have ever experienced. The time between getting seated and ordering drinks and food: 15 minutes. The time between that and learning that the kitchen is out of pears for a friend's order: 10 minutes. The time between drinks arriving and food arriving: 40 minutes. The rice in my burrito was ice cold. Everything else in it was warm, but the rice was frigid. But hey, at least all the food came out, right? Sadly no, not all the food. My friend's eggs came out ten minutes after that, which is impressive because THEY'RE EGGS, how long does it take to make eggs? My friend immediately asks why her food took so long to come out and the server couldn't get the manager fast enough. The manager comes out and asks what's up. My friend explains the situation and asks for her food to be comped, because we're basically done eating at this point. I send my food back because it's basically inedible. The manager, for reasons passing understanding, offers to box up my questionably-cooked burrito for free. I sent it back anyway, because that's how bad it was.  The manager fires off a half dozen apologies in rapid succession and then nearly sprints away, never to be seen again. Fast forward twenty minutes. Our server hasn't returned or checked in or apologized or brought the check over despite walking past the table several times. We're all done eating and just want to get out of there. We had to flag down a busser, ask them to print out the check, and bring it over. To their credit, they did so immediately.  The server made their way over five minutes after that and cluelessly asked if we wanted any dessert. We assured them that we were all set, had the check, and wanted to get out of there. Rather than taking the check, they cleared two plates and dipped, also never to be seen or heard from again. Five minutes after that, we hailed a busser, had a second manager run our check, and got out of there.

Priscilla T.,"San Mateo, CA",108,36,12,2.0,10/26/2013,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to!! Since this location is fairly new I gave it a few tries but it certainly disappoints in at least one way EVERY SINGLE TIME... Now let's get started... First of all because Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, there are certain expectations and standards they need to live up to.. The first time I came was about a month after opening and I ordered my regular dishes of crab poppers, crispy fried artichoke hearts, salmon firecracker rolls and miso salmon. ALL THE DISHES WERE 2/3 THE SIZE OF THE OTHER RESTAURANTS. and it took a REALLLY long time for our food to come out. Disappointing. So I didn't go back for a while.  Another time I ordered the crispy crab poppers,which usually comes out in six pieces, it came out looking horrible. It was like one popper had broken and they tried to camouflage it as two so in reality we were missing one.. Minus points on being cheap and crappy presentation. We returned it and they made a new one, but this whole situation could have been avoided if they put some thought into it. The worst part was that when we complained, the waitress said she saw that it already didn't look right when she brought it out....Uh so you were just trying to get by with serving a SUBPAR dish!? Not cool  FFWD to my last time going (as in this will be the last time I ever go to this location, I'd rather make the trek to Palo Alto). More incompetent wait staff..our waitress never refilled our water.. When our salad came out wrong and missing the grapes she didn't even say sorry, she just took it back and threw some grapes on top..it's supposed to be tossed.. One of my number one pet peeves is when they do not take responsibility andDONT SAY SORRY. instead she tries to argue w the customer. Do they teach u nothing here?! Also the bus boy cleared the dish from the table as I still had my spoon in the plate scooping something.. I hate to use the word incompetent so much...but they really are..a lot of them need to go back to training. And every time I come here I just end up leaving annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=320

I went with my parents for lunch and we ordered the new potato skin tater tots? (not sure on the real name of the dish). They were fried tater tots filled with bacon and cheese and sour cream on the side. They were delicious! For lunch my parents each ordered Renee's special (Half sandwich, side salad, AND cup of soup). The soup of the day was a bean and bacon soup. It was similar to a minestrone, very good! I ordered the lunch Cobb salad with dressing on the side. The portion was HUGE! If mine was the lunch size, I can't imagine how large the normal size is! The salad has plenty of grilled chicken breast and bacon, all topped with egg.  Our server was Jan, I think. He was wonderful! Very attentive and knew the menu really well! When we asked for bread, there was only white bread at the time, but he made sure to bring us the brown honeywheat bread as soon as it came out of the oven (still hot!) When I asked for a box to take the rest of my enormous salad home, he offered to pack it up for me. He even packed up dressing on the side for me and put a few extra loaves of bread for us to take home.  Jan is awesome!

So they called their manager to come by because the card was still valid because of the DATE. The manager told me that he could do nothing because the computer said it was expired even though it was obviously still valid. LIKE REALLY!?   I came all the way down here to eat WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN CHEESECAKE!?! What kind of customer service is this? Does the computer make all the decisions here?

Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9798,55713,4.0,9/19/2011,"I have a friend that is contemplating opening a restaurant. We bounced ideas of business operations/logistics, staffing, concepts and what not. The most important thing to him I stressed is the business concept. A restaurant is more than just cooking, it is a business first and foremost. The food is what brings you in. Now some people may say that Cheesecake Factory is an altar to American excess and it's a chain, but if you look at it closely it's kind of a brilliantly run business. In the early days it took $250K to open one. Now it's north of $2 million however that number is consistent with each and every one they open. Also when they open anywhere, it's crowded, and their operations for the most part are super smooth because they 1. Know their core customer 2. Have the staff and cooks trained in a precise way 3. their food always tastes consistent. Whether you're in Chicago or LA or anywhere in between.  It's almost an exact science. The staff, the decor, the items on the menu (though there are some regional differences), how the expeditors process orders and maintain flow (they are absolute beasts that monitor the line), and everything else is calculated. For a restaurant to have 200+ seats and do 3-4 turns during a service is just amazing.   Now you can choose to like the food or not, but you have to say that they're a pretty well run business. So my friend and I came here on opening day to see how it would go. Somehow he scored a great patio table and we started chatting.  We split the samosas which are done with a phyllo pastry and ground chicken with much lighter spices. A way to ease middle America into Indian flavors. We then went for old fashioned American excess, meatloaf with huge mashed potatoes, and a fried macaroni and cheese burger. Yes you heard that right. Don't forget to add bacon. Surprisingly it was tasty and I could feel my health go downhill with each bite. Mac and Ceese and a burger plus bacon all in one? Why didn'y I think of that? When then split a cherry cheesecake to finish.  Our server was awesome with her great support staff and for a first day, full covers packed to the gills, it felt no different than any other CF I've been to. That's their brilliance. Offer something familiar in a universal way, with tons of choices and things that normally maybe adventurous formulate it in a friendly way.  I have no problem with excess. I just take it in moderation! Half my food came home with me as a second meal. Unsurprisingly a non chalant, predictable opening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=320

Bad: - huge menu - wait - too much frosting on (some) cheesecakes I recently had the raspberry lemon, mango, and Oreo cheesecake. The raspberry lemon was my favorite. It was justifiable to have some frosting on it since the bottom layer is actual cake. I still have to scrape half of it off. The mango was the most dense. I like that it didn't have any frosting. Mango'ness was a bit faint and sweetness was overwhelming. The Oreo was very rich but almost half if it was frosting -- a thick thick layer of chocolate frosting then a second later of ""cookie and cream."" Too much frosting. I feel cheated. Humph. We also dine here once but likely won't go back again. It's not their fault. My kids just love their shiny floor too much and they don't like their kid's menu enough to eat here.

Food is always good, usually get some sliders and some other mini portion as an appetizer.

I had my 30th Birthday Party here with my family.  I stopped in about 3 hours ahead of time and spoke with the manager because it was a busy Saturday evening, and dinner was around 7-730 so they told me to come back and ""check in"" at 6 (1 hour ahead of time) and they will make sure they have a table ready. I appreciate all the help they provided me on that special day and I was extremely happy with our food, service, and of course, my birthday.

I have an issue with menus that are 50 pages long and simply the fact that it is a chain restaurant. They had new menu items in an extra pamphlet called Skinny items. I really do hate CF and their concept of 50 pounds of low quality food on a plate. But I had no choice :( Hubby got a veggie pasta dish with no oil or butter. Just veggies and wheat pasta noodles. It had zucchini, squash, tomatoes etc. it was nothing special.  I got a veggie salad that had 50 pounds of edamame on it. The freshness of the salad was ok it had cucumbers, carrots, etc etc, no cheese, no croutons. I chose to have plain balsamic vinegar on side to occasionally dip or drizzle.  I try to avoid GMO and non-organic but I ate some of the salad and left the other 30 pounds of it :) I survived my visit to CF :) they should really shorten the menu and 1/3 the portions...wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=340

I chose to write this review after having many terrible experiencing dining here. Last night I was dining in the bar and was greeted by a very unfriendly, unprofessional server. After having to ask for bread after sitting there for about 15 minutes she walked to the table next to us and chose to hangout with her friends along with the manager who was sitting down with them, completely ignoring our request. Finally, our food was brought out by a different food runner-clearly having sat in the window for a while. Our sever finally came over and again we had to ask for bread (since she never brought it), drink refills, and the check- twice.

After we were finally seated they told us that the wait staff would be with us soon.  Then they sat another table and the other table placed their order and received their food before we did; to add to my frustration. Ordered the Chicken lettuce wrap tacos - chicken was bland and Stuffed mushrooms - which were actually decent.  Ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and requested NO whipped cream, and of course what do they put all over it!!!!!

Derek W.,"San Mateo, CA",102,91,60,3.0,4/12/2015,"3 1/2 stars. The Cheesecake Factory is very famous and popular as a nice restaurant for a while now. But it's precisely what the name describes it as. A place built for cheesecake. The cheesecake here is awesome and can probably take up all of your cheat meals for the next year. But as a restaurant as a whole it isn't all that hot. I have been there now multiple times. Every time I go I try to order a different pasta, hoping that it will turn out better than the first couple of times. Every time I go I am let down again. For the attire, it looks like a fancy restaurant, no doubt. But it doesn't match the quality of the food. Most of the food here also can have you put on a couple of pounds and has you feeling full for the next week.  Bottom line: Come here for cheesecake and nothing else. You could probably come for some food but overall it isn't worth it. You're better off just going somewhere else for dinner then coming here for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=340
Brittany T.,"Daly City, CA",3,7,9,4.0,4/11/2016,"I've been here a good number of times and to be honest the dishes start tasting the same (or maybe it's because I'm always ordering pasta). It's fairly emptier understandably earlier in the day so the wait to be seated is nonexistent.  Do expect to wait though if you come later in the day.  The ambience is always nice (especially at night, so cozy) and the place is fairly clean.  The service is good and I've only ever had one bad experience with the waiters.  Today's waitress was exceptionally polite and was the reason why I added another star.  One extra star for you glen coco.  The bread appetizer as per usual was delicious especially since it's warm and freshly made.  The wait for our pasta was reasonable and the waitress was always ready with a drink refill. The shrimp angel hair pasta was alright, just lacked a bit of something.  The avocado egg roll appetizer was also good but even with the pasta and appetizer split between my mom and I, we could barely finish everything. So beware of the portions (not necessarily bad to have so much though, just be aware). We finished off with a slice of cookie dough cheesecake and of course this was the cherry on top of our visit because who comes here and doesn't try cheesecake?! I have yet to try all the flavors but I vow to do so one day.  After we laid down the surrender flag, we ordered some more pasta, cheesecake, and bread to go which was a very convenient process altogether.

The guy at the cake counter did not know the difference between the Linda fudge cake and the black out cake except that one had 9 layers and then discovered that the other one too had 9 layers. He didn't even know what nuts were on that one cake. The other lady who was with him behind the counter rudely switched the names of the cakes and did not help the guy when he asked her what's the difference between the two. When I ordered a slice, he said there is only one cashier and she is busy there in the kitchen (pointed to the kitchen).  When another customer came up, that was the only time he called the cashier. A woman customer that was walking around came up, apparently she had asked the guy about something earlier. The cashier got her order which took time because the woman had not made up her mind yet. Meanwhile me my wife and I waited for her to finish, thinking we would me next to be accommodated. After the woman finished her order, the stupid cashier asked the third customer (the one who came after us) what his order was, completely ignoring us even when the guy we talked to told her that we were next!

I decided on their ahi tuna dinner salad and my husband ordered the tamale cakes. The tamale cakes were good, so they get a second star for that. The ahi tuna dinner salad was a box filled with mixed greens, 2 thick slices of tomatoes, some slices of avocado, and 4 small pieces of seared ahi tuna. For an $18 dinner salad, I expected more than 4 pieces of tuna and at least some tomatoes that were properly sliced.

The portion is also HUGE - so be prepared to take home half for lunch or dinner the next day. They also offer lots of bread and what I like is that it's always toasty. I hate when cold bread comes to the table. I also like the setup of this Cheesecake. There's inside seating, inside seating...inside the mall, and then outside seating as well. And what's cool about the outside seating is that during the summer, the glass goes up so you can enjoy the weather, and during the winter, it comes down to be completely enclosed.

I have enjoyed this many times in the past but have not had it recently. The recipe seems to have changed. The sauce was much more thin and there was a ridiculously large amount of (overly) toasted coconut on top. It changed the whole texture and flavor profile of the dish and I ate less than a quarter of it before letting my server know I was disappointed in it. She simply asked ""Have you actually had the dish before?"" It should be a manager's job to troubleshoot my complaint, not hers. If there's a guest complaint, a manager needs to get involved. To her credit, she did apologize, but no manager visited the table to address my concern; she most likely didn't tell a manager at all. In any event, subsequently, she didn't take it off the bill or even offer a replacement dish. The server was friendly besides that and gave reasonably good service, but not sure if I'll be returning.

Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,2.0,7/31/2012,"2 stars seems harsh, but it's fair at the same time because it really is, ""Meh, I've experienced better.""  I came on National Cheese Cake Day (July 30, 2012) and my friend and I expected it to be busy -- it wasn't. They were able to seat us right away, in front of the bathroom. Yup, of all the tables they had, they chose to seat us in front of the bathroom. I kept staring at the ""Restroom"" sign at the top of the door entrance. Okay, the bathroom thing wasn't that big of a deal since it didn't smell, I didn't hear toilet/sink noses, and it's a good walk to the potty. But really, half the restaurant was empty and we get seated in front of the bathroom. Our server was relatively friendly and checked up on us. But not once did we get water refills. The complementary bread wasn't brought out until requested. When the bread came out, it was hard and lukewarm. The butter was solid and cold. I had my favorite dish: salisbury steak with mash potatoes and string beans My entree came out warm, not as hot as other location. Because of the coolness, it took the pa-zzas out of it for me. The meal wasn't as staisfying. The salibury steak also tasted a bit old and not as fresh.Another thing I noticed was that they added pepper to my beans. Pepper was never added to my dish, ever, at all the Cheese Cake Factory locations I've been to. I took the meal home after about 10 bites and ate the rest for dinner. Tasted better, but definitely could have more potential.  My friend and I also ordered the avocado eggrolls. This was delicious! The sauce makes it so much better. It tastes best as soon as it comes out because once it cools doesn't taste as good.  For dessert, naturally, we had cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake to be exact. It was tasty the first few bites but then it started getting too thick because of all the cream and too sweet, again because of the cream. I wish they had more bread to the cheesecake.  The avocado eggrolls were the highlight of the meal. It was disappointing because my friend and I were really looking forward to National Cheese Cake Day.

I find myself here for lunch or sometimes a really late dinner (since it is open late in the Hillsdale area). The servers I have had are really nice. They make sure that my guest and I are not waiting for drinks or waiting around to place our orders in. They also make sure to let us know the progress of our orders, which is a PLUS. I usually order the hibachi steak, rare. I love that they do this better than other Cheesecake Factories I have been to! True to The Cheesecake Factory standards, the portions are very big, especially with the potato! The cheesecakes are the same all around, so I will not have a special comment about that, other than they are good. I also love that I can order their wheat bread and take them to go if I do not get extras during my meal. The wheat bread is sooo good, I thought it was rye! Anyway, I would come back here again.

Ruce U.,"Daly City, CA",258,19,48,5.0,4/14/2014,"Prior to being here a couple times before, my last visit to Cheesecake in San Mateo pretty much hit the bar! That night, we were pushing our time pretty tight to closing time (11PM) but managed to get there 30 minutes prior. Soon after parking, and making our way in, we have realized how chill, quiet, and space of parking their was. We got the closest parking spot and hardly anybody was there, so I must say it jumped our night just a bit in a positive manner, so thats a plus! After being seated by our lovely waitress, LAURA P, she greeted us with such gratitude and a lovely smile, and gave us time to make our orders. Small conversations and such, with our environment being slightly quiet at this time of night, it was quite beautiful and chill. Our waitress gave us apple time to make decisions and also helped us choose what kind of craving we were looking for, which definitely helped us narrow our results down to something worth trying, and was quite impressed. The appetizers of Bread and Butter was delicious, and fresh to the touch. My date then informed the waitress of how great bread was, which the waitress took into consideration of bagging up some wheat bread for us. I was quite surprised by this random act of kindness, and we both had really big smiles on our faces.  After receiving our orders of the Hibachi Steak and the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, we just stared at our food... then of course, INSTAGRAMed it lol. Then continued to enjoy the rest of our meal. Speak on behalf of the steak (Since that is what I have ordered) was tender and made with love lol Shortly after mentioning that the dinner night was intended for missing her birthday three weeks prior, it was my late gift for her. Our waitress Laura P, was very generous and had such a sweet heart, and seemed spontaneous. A few minutes after mentioning that, she brought us a bag of wheat bread, an Icecream with a candle, and sung happy birthday... even though it wasn't her birthday lol.

Every single time I come here the service is nonexistent and they never give us any attention. Whether it be a few of us with less than 5 people or a group of 20 people, it doesn't matter, they don't care. Their general manager should be fired for not overseeing the details of customer service. I've ordered to go pick up twice from them. The first experience I encountered they told me it would take 30 minutes. I showed up around the 45 minute mark so they could have some extra time to prepare the stuff in case they were backed up. Those 15 minutes did not matter whatsoever. I had to wait an extra 45 minutes - 1 hour for my to go order of TWO SALADS AND THE CORN TAMALES. Please tell me why. And the last straw was tonight. My family order 2 hours ahead since last time it was such a disaster. I get there and the person taking my payment didn't smile at me once. She just mugged me and never said thank you or even please. NOTHING. IF YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THEN DON'T WORK IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. Then after 2 minutes this guy comes and asks who's order was it and she points to me. He tells me, ""uhh..we are gonna have to remake your order.""  I asked him why and I told him he doesn't need to, it's ok if it's cold I can warm it up at home and that I don't mind. He repeats himself and says, ""no we need to remake it because you took too long."" OK thanks for customer blaming. No one apologized and no one said anything. No one even told me how long it was going to take. By the time I got my food the original girl that I paid asked me, ""Did you pay?""

Gen Q.,"Bay Area, CA",35,9,,5.0,1/8/2015,"I went to have lunch with some friends here a few days ago and I wanted to write a review mainly for what happened at the end of our dining experience. I had brought some late Christmas gifts for someone at the lunch and in the process of handing a gift across the table I knocked over a bottle of olive oil breaking it and it began to spill across the table! We tried to contain it with all of our napkins and some baby wet wipes while a friend went to get someone to help us out. Of course I felt absolutely terrible for making the mess but the young man who came over to help, who I believe was also the host, named Anthony was unbelievably gracious and helped clear the table while cracking jokes to get me to stop apologizing. That could have easily irritated (understandably) any employee and I could have been given the stank eye and the silent treatment! Anyway, I just wanted to give Anthony a 5-star review for his wonderful service and great attitude!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=400

As for the main meal, I ordered the Tomato Bazil Mozzarella pasta and some more of the brown bread and butter which is complementary. The ambiance is slightly dim in the exterior and there are high ceilings as the decor as well as high and wide glass windows to view the outside's weather. Overall, the whole experience is lovely. It would be even more great to have more money from the gift card that was given for a birthday gift and I would be more than happy to return to this location since there is no parking hassle as oppose to the 8th floor Cheese Cake Factory in San Francisco.

V W.,"Las Vegas, NV",572,602,197,3.0,9/19/2014,"I would usually give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars, but this visit was just a tad disappointing. I ordered an Asian chicken salad and requested no onions and dressing on the side and about 20 minutes later I get a salad with dressing on it. If I weren't watching my macros I would have just eaten the salad, but since I have to be strict with what I eat I had them remake it. Basically by the time I had got the second salad about another 20 minutes had gone by and I was totally starving and kinda hangry. To make matters worse when my salad arrived I tell you the truth that it was just a bunch of puff. An avalanche of lettuce and rice noodles with approximately 2 oz of Mandarins and about 2 - 3 oz of chicken breast. In all honesty if I'm going to be paying $15 for just a salad then you have to at least put a decent amount of chicken so I can actually justify paying this much. In all fairness I would say 5-6 oz would be the right amount for $15 and I'm sure your still making money off my $15 salad. The whole thing was a HUGE let down and I wasn't going to say anything, but when the waitress came and asked how everything was, I simply stated that it wasn't so great, because there was hardly any meat on there. I guess she truly listened to my honest complaint and also acknowledged that it did take a really long time to get my food, because the order got screwed up in the first place. So she decided to comp my meal, which was an awesome generous thing to do. Overall I'm super glad that they decided to make things right and this here is a good example of why I'll keep coming back to Cheesecake Factory.

While this restaurant has a very large number of selections on its menu, I could only choose between one or two at the most. I am on a gluten-free diet and I'll admit that not every restaurant caters to people like me. Before arriving, I was prepared to choose from a smaller number of selections than those who do not share my dietary restrictions.  When I discovered just how large the menu was with very little attempt to provide for those with restricted diets I was surprised. So many dishes I could not eat. For several of the dishes I was considering I had to ask the server to check with the chef as to whether or not there was gluten involved in the preparation. After a long wait, my choices got narrowed down to just one.  In addition, the place was a zoo with a long waiting time to be seated and long waits between service by very young and seemingly inexperienced servers. The reason I gave two stars is that once I got the food, it tasted quite good. Everything else about the experience was terribly disappointing though.

Since it's a treat for me to be here on a Sunday, I ordered off that menu. I got the bruleed French toast. It was two big pieces of thick bread with a thin egg layer. I don't know what exactly made it brulee-d. Also both my pieces were pretty burned on the edges. I had to cut around a lot of it. Also I think it was $12 for the two pieces of French toast and no sides. Not really worth it. I'd go for other options. My friends had the burgers, lunch portions of the entrée and full size entrees. We also got a side of fries for the table and it was like a huge overflowing plate of fires - a lot. The full size entress are almost $20 but it's pretty big portions. Oh and the table split two pieces of cheesecake - lemon meringue and the godiva chocolate. Good thing, we were all pretty full and the cheesecake was pretty rich. Service was fine.

We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (consistently tasty), and Nachos (ok).  Wifey had the Chinese Chicken Salad (nice crispy noodles added good texture), and I had the Green Chili Burger (green chili and jalapenos with crispy tortilla strips definitely added).  Overall the food was good quality, and plates arrived pretty timely.  But was it worth an hour wait???  Not sure...  It was just OK for me.  I have to say that they stay pretty consistent with the quality from location to location.  I also feel that I prefer their dinner entree's over the lunch dishes. The layout of this place was pretty nicely spread out with outside seating as well.  Service was friendly and attentive as well.   We grabbed two cheesecakes to go: pumpkin (tasted like pumpkin pie- ok), and coconut cream (chocolate macaroon crust was yum).  Definitely, the highlight from this place.

I used to love this place a few years ago- even came here to celebrate my birthday with family once and extremely enjoyed it. But yesterday, I was accompanied with one of my friends and from the moment we sat down, the disaster started.  My friend and I were handed menus and the waitress asked if we wanted drinks. We just wanted water to start and hadn't even glanced at the menu yet, but she came back twice more asking if we wanted drinks. Well, after the horrifying experience, I felt I needed one! My mug of water had a lipstick stain on it! And it was not mine! I thought maybe it was an old stain that wouldn't come off during the washing process- um, no! It wiped off like that stain was just put there seconds ago! I told the waitress and she just said, ""Ew! And ran away with it."" Um, ok. I guess no apology is needed.  It took about 20-25 minutes to get some bread, and that's after we waited and asked for some. Nice cold, hard bread. Did this chic just not like me?  The chicken in my pasta was a little burned. Didn't eat it. The pasta was bland. My friends lettuce wraps were all blackened on the ends. My friend just looked stunned when she sees that and the waitress goes, oh they're big so u can put a lot of stuff inside. Yeah, we looked like that bc the lettuce was black, not bc they were huge lettuce leafs. Dang.  Whatever. We were trying to be polite about everything, but when it felt like asking for a straw was above and beyond and splitting checks was a burden, I decided not to come back to this appalling restaurant again.

Little did I know that THIS was going in there! H&M and something else alongside, I was floored when I drove to CalTrain to pick up the Husband. When did Hillsdale get so fashionable, and WHY am I not shopping there right now? The Husband and I came here for one thing: dessert. Sure, it was a Friday night around 6:30-7, but it was packed. Apparently if you didn't have a reservation, you weren't getting in. The bar area was also completely packed. We just wanted cheesecake, what's the deal!? Thankfully, they have a take-out counter where you can order slices (or whole) of cheesecake to-go. We got a fudge layer cake and Adam's Peanut Butter something. Total: $16, including tax. WHAT?! For two pieces of cheesecake it's $8/piece?! I can MAKE my own cheesecake, and I have, for less money than that. You get it at wholesale prices, too, how can you justify such costs? It didn't even blow my mind, either. I mean, it's good - because it's cheesecake - but it's not like other desserts I've had that were utterly divine. I'm used to the San Francisco location (above Macy's?) being totally and completely packed constantly, at all hours of the day. There is no such thing as a ""15 minute wait"" in SF, but considering they've opened more locations along the peninsula, you would think the wait time would decrease. Not so much. I hope their food isn't meh, because I can see myself being dragged here with the Husband because I declined one night to not indulge in cookery by baking one myself. If the service is more meh, I'll just be wildly disappointed. Of course, I can always be bribed with clothes shopping to burn off the whooping 1200 calories a slice I just shoved in my mouth. Woo!

As I chewed into one I noticed it's not a chicken texture. I looked into it and it looked like a hard noodle but it turned out to be squid/calamari.

Came back in 25 just to make sure we had not gotten called already and even had one of their visual pagers to alert when the table was ready. They confirmed still another 10 minutes... The rest of the time we were waiting in the lobby. After 20 minutes checked again and they claimed 2nd on the list. After watching party after party getting seated I again check-in and they claimed they had called me. Total BS and the pager never went off. I then escalated to the ""manager"" who basically showed little interest in their poor service but claimed we were ""next"". That translated to another 8 minutes. So basically an hour and 15 minutes later we were seated from the quoted 30-40 minutes. Where upon we were put in a section with 5 empty tables and promptly got ignored for another 10 minutes. Throughout the rest of dinner pretty much had inattentive service. The food was OK as typical. The fact that the ""manager"" did nothing to make reasonable amends and seemed to just put us int he ""B team"" service area, invariably as punishment for having the audacity to ""complain"".  We finally got done at 8:28PM!

The first thing she brought to our table after we ordered was the salad dressing for my salad. 3. We asked what happened to our drinks after 10 mins. 4.

Our order came, the runner insisted that we ordered nachos, told her at least 5 times..NO WE DIDN'T! ! 7. FINALLY our food arrive after 30 mins of waiting and our extra request weren't followed.

Is it busy or short staff. He post and looked lost and finally said, were busy. The place was half empty. This is one of our favorite place to go.

Overall, CF is an okay choice when you don't know exactly what you want to eat as there are many options, though everything is so caloric and in huge portions, I'm glad they have a ""Skinny"" part of the menu.   Note to all my fellow iPhone users....signal is horrible in here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=440

Their American-Style Kobe-beef burger was perfectly seared medium (as requested), topped with grilled onions and fresh sauteed mushrooms (which I swear tasted like sliced fresh shitake mushrooms). Excellent. Their thin sliced sweet potato fries were good but could have used a dipping sauce, as a chipotle mayo sauce was served with a full portion, but not with a side order to the burger (unless requested). Service too was good and the waitress even described their special cheesecake (a devilishly inspired Mango Key-Lime over a crust that had shredded coconut in it) that forced us to abandon all hope of splitting a single plain cheesecake slice and getting this special slice in addition. We weren't sorry, although if you are in it for the purity of simple cheesecake, you might have found that there was too much going on.

We got the check & left the waiter a tip, but we neglected to scratch a line thru the tip section on the receipt, so this asshole decides to take advantage of this and charges himself a 20 DOLLAR TIP after we already left him one IN CASH!! We didn't even notice until my boyfriend saw his bank statement & wondered when the hell we spend 90 dollars at the Cheesecake Factory.. Now the second time we went, it was for a friend's birthday. We started off with a waiter but half way thru our stay there he turned it over to another waiter & guess who it was? The asshole waiter from last time. Well it looked like he remembered who we were because he avoided eye contact & rarely came to check on us. This time around I ordered nothing but a soda and a cheesecake. Only two people in our group are actual food. We asked if the check could be divided according to what each of us had ordered & he told us we could only divide the check in half or pay the full amount. BULLSHIT. I've been to this restaurant plenty of times & they have divided the check upon our party's request. Well I didn't argue any further & paid for the whole party's meal with my card. Of course I didn't forget last time's incident so I scratched the shit out of the Tip section on the receipt & on top of that we left no tip. Yes. You can call it a dick move but considering what he did last time plus he didn't check up on us for refills or anything else we may have needed that night. Well the gathering concluded & we were halfway to our car when the waiter calls after us ""Did you mean to purposely not leave a tip for me?"" WTF. Really?? He really had the audacity to chase us outside the fucking restaurant just to complain about his tip.

Eric C.,"San Francisco, CA",212,387,417,2.0,10/11/2013,"Dear Hillsdale cheesecake factory. You will now be compared to Union square cheesecake factory.  By now after reading then first line. You could almost assume that this location is in imminent danger of getting ripped and chewed out like Hi-Chews from chinatown ... and from what went on down here. They would either need that or a total turnover of a number of wait staff... Granted there are some competent staff members here that deserve to keep their jobs. But others here would prefer to try to hit on and get with their coworkers before paying attention to the customers. Not the newest discovery in a chain restaurant.   However I am fairly sure that when your immediate guests include a bowler who is used to adapting his hearing to constant clanging, banging and high pitched screaming and arguing on the lanes + a couple of military personnel who are accustomed to IED and other explosives going off in short proximity from them  in addition to a number of patrons in their golden years sitting right by us...yet we can still hear your conversations without having to mute our silverware..then clearly you have a problem or just can't wait to hit on the girl you work with huh? Anyways back the food. Having ordered what cheesecake considers their rendition of the ""western"" burger/smokehouse... the first things I notice are the following two things... A)I think your BBQ sauce dispenser literally had an incident of the runs...cause I had to use a fork and knife to find the meat. (Don't complicate that statement)  [-1] B) By the time I did find the meat. I was worried about whether OE not the chef himself had the runs too haha..man was it dry....(don't complicate that statement either). [-1] By the time I even got through trying to finish the dish...all of the hot fried rings and grilles Bacon...coupled with the cooked to death beef patty didn't even allow me to consider the dessert menu. Which Is what the establishment is known for... How does it stack up to SF  Pros -- Cheaper parking Cons-- Because of then area its in. Hillsdale staff is seemingly the equivalent to the company practice squad when compared to SF's roster...at least when I've been here and there it seems as such.. What's the final negative star? - The parking + our particular female served kept it from being a total 0-1 star embarrassment however... we had to get our silverware sets  replaced due to unsanitary conditions. Kinda hard to tell till you unwrap your place mat but it was a standing issue that was resolved...however it will still count against you..just like a state health inspection.... which reminds me...thank god your bathrooms had space....but you could afford to have more stalls and urinals.. especially given your portions, quality and location....think SFO when you consider your bathroom layouts...it will be more convenient..no one standing in the covered urinal wants to be in the same immediate space as someone deciding to play battle-shit am I Right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=540

It was bloated, post-Tuscan, too-many-choice-kill-them-with-calorific-horror-coma choice menu bedazzle them with marble and make it up with a mark up.

Cicily C.,"San Francisco, CA",244,60,50,5.0,12/8/2014,"This review is mostly based on the service. I came here for dinner and the wait was only like 5 minutes long on a Wednesday night. The food was nothing too fancy but I still enjoyed it, like usual. I usually get some sort of pasta & I'm always satisfied. Anyway. Our waitress, Makaila (I probably misspelled that), was awesome. She helped me pull a fast one on my boyfriend and let me grab the check before we were done eating. She even had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on our cheesecake plate even though it wasn't requested or anything. When we were done eating and my boyfriend asked for the bill, she even handed him a fake bill that said that the bill was taken care of. It was really nice of her to go along with me. It was refreshing to get such good service at a restaurant. These 5 stars go right to her :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=540

For all you calories counters, the skinnylicious salmon rolls are delicious! Comes with 4 long skinny rolls and two different dipping sauces, both of which are so flavorful. Total thumbs up! And for all you crab lovers, I can absolutely vouch for their amazing crabcakes! Jam packed with so much meat. Most crab cakes I've had contain a lot of breading so the crab taste is far gone. But these, although small/medium in size, are full of meat. Their mustard and tartar sauces are awesome too, but I definitely prefer the tartar. Only gripe is that it comes with 3 cakes.

Desmond C.,"San Mateo, CA",80,160,3,1.0,3/29/2012,"Avoid this place! (Unless the only thing you're getting is the cheesecake). WARNING #1: You'll get better service at McDonald's. WARNING #2: You're server might introduce themselves and never come back to serve you! And they'll oddly come back at the end of the night to see how you're doing. AWKWARD! CLEANLINESS: 2/5 SERVICE: 0/5 (My first 0.) FOOD: 3/5 - BBQ/Ranch Chicken Salad OH BOY, where do I even start? I'm not a big fan of giving bad reviews, but this location left me no choice. Let's start with the cleanliness of this place. The decor and atmosphere looks really nice, I'll give them that. However, it bothers me that the utensils are placed DIRECTLY on the dirty table and NOT wrapped in a towel like most restaurants. You've seen waiters wipe those tables... if you even call it wiping. Service is TERRIBLE. Probably the worst I have ever gotten from a restaurant in my entire life. Once we got seated, we weren't given the towel napkins and the complimentary bread wasn't served. Then we got our order in. Still no napkins and bread. 30-40 minutes went by and now we're wondering where our waitress had gone. We look over at tables that got seated after us and they already got their bread and food! Still no sign of our waitress. Then another waitress sees us looking around really hard to find someone, and she kindly asks us if we needed help. She immediately notices that we weren't given bread or any napkins. (She saved our day. Thank you!). Here's a snippet of our dialog: Me: Uhm, do you know what happened to our waitress? Waitress #2: Uh, I'm not sure, but let me get you guys some bread. Me: Wait, is she even still here? Waitress #2: I think so, she might be on her break. Me: Oh, okay... Thanks. So, apparently Waitress #1 went on her break without us even knowing. So Waitress #2 notices that we already received poor service (or LACK OF SERVICE), and she immediately gives our table a little more attention. Thank you, again! Now, an hour as passed and finally our food gets to our table. Oh, but wait. THEY FORGOT MY ORDER. Waitress #2 notices that everyone at our table got their dishes except me. She literally said, ""Wait, you're food didn't come yet? That's crazy, you ordered a salad."" (Or something along those lines). I believe she told the manager about the service we've been receiving because he comes over about 10 minutes later with my salad and apologizes. Here's our dialog: Manager: I'm so sorry. We'll take the salad off the bill.  Me: Uh, what's the name of the first waitress? (He didn't say.) Did she just leave because the last time I saw her was 45 minutes ago. Manager: We're required to give our employees a break after 5 hours of work. OKAY. Where do I even start? I didn't ask for you to tell me your company policy on how you treat your employees. At most restaurants, whenever the waiter/waitresses are covering for one another, they come up to the customer and literally tell them that they have a new server for the evening. (THEY DID NOT DO THIS.) Hell, Waitress #2 didn't even know Waitress #1 went on a break! Thank god Waitress #2 saw us looking for some service or else we would of just walked out. We finally get to eat our food (which was mediocre).  Now the most awkward thing happens. WAITRESS #1 MAGICALLY SHOWS UP AT OUR TABLE! Oh god, I don't know what to do with myself. I really wanted to just yell at her, but the whole situation was so awkward. The Cheesecake factory must treat their employees poorly because Waitress #1 had enough time to abandon their customer and then show up towards the end of the night to TRY to service us. Keyword: TRY. Sorry, you failed completely.  I do give kudos to Waitress #2 for saving the night. Also, kudos to the Manager for taking 2 dishes off the bill. Oh, and did I mention it was my brothers birthday? Yeah, happy birthday to him. FAIL. My brother did get a complimentary cheesecake for his b-day. The manager offered cheesecake all around, but we didn't take the offer because it would of probably arrived at the time the restaurant closed. Or they might of forgotten our order. (The place wasn't even busy!) FAIL FAIL FAIL. It was also our first time at this location (probably our last). Maybe I'll come back after a couple years if this location is still here.

Jerri L.,"Burlingame, CA",48,21,14,1.0,2/27/2014,"Super unprofessional and extremely unacceptable. Called a week before my boss's birthday to inquire about reservations because this was my first time making a reservation. They told me that they do not do reservations, which is understandable. I asked them how would I go about fitting in a party of 18 people. The hostess or whoever answered the phone told me to come an hour before our scheduled dinner for somebody to put our name and number on the list and they will give us a call when our table is ready. I was pleased and a little relieved that we wouldn't have to wait so long if we all went in a bunch.. So I emailed 18 of my coworkers and told them dinner is at 7 p.m.. One of my coworkers was nice enough to head to the Cheesecake Factory to put our name on the list an hour and a half before 7 p.m.. The hostess was extremely rude and told her  ""that's impossible, your table will not be ready until 830 or 845"" My coworker was stunned because that wasn't the plan. She panicked and did not know what to do. Being an assistant manager at an establishment that strives for customer service, this was extremely unacceptable and beyond unprofessional. I was appalled. I had 18 people heading to this restaurant for a big surprise dinner for my boss and this is what happens and this is how they treat us? I immediately called The Cheesecake Factory and ask to speak to the manager to see what was the problem. Patrick, the manager told me in the most condescending tone that the hostess never said. And that he wasn't going to do anything about it and that we would have to wait until 845.  Really??? I was extremely pissed off. I rerouted 18 of my coworkers to a much better restaurant which was Elephant Bar in Burlingame. Not only were they able to fit us in but treated us with amazing customer service and the food was beyond tasty. My boss and my coworkers ended up enjoying our dinner. Its either they change their stupid no reservation policy.

They're all really sweet ladies, but their grasp of the English language ranges from great to spotty and everything in-between! This Cheesecake Factory is much the same as any location in the chain. Large, spacious, clean, and well-staffed. They must have had like six people waiting up at the front to greet people. We had a party of 14 which they had no problem accommodating. I got the turkey burger with a side salad instead of fries (trying to watch my girlish figure). The burger was huge and the patty was really tasty and looked like it was hand crafted instead of pulled out of a CostCo bag. It came with some yummy grilled onions and a big slice of fresh tomato. The side salad was a basic mix of greens, tomato, and cucumber with a light vinegar dressing. Throughout the meal, the staff kept our drinks full, our plates cleared, and patiently took care of requests that weren't stated in clear English. All the ladies were really happy!

Tami S.,"San Mateo, CA",162,474,156,3.0,7/2/2012,"I had been a little apprehensive to eat here... not sure why. Maybe it's the rumors of the ENORMOUS portions, the tales of lengthy waits for a table, and the impression I had that everything was a calorie-fest. But no fear, we were seated right away, service was efficient and friendly, and everything was good. Had a nice Sunday lunch here with friends, and enjoyed sitting on the ""patio"" (which is actually inside the mall).  LOTS of choices -- I can't imagine someone looking through the novel that is the Cheesecake Factory menu and saying ""nope, nothing I want to eat here."" They have just about every taste covered, from herculean salads, to burgers and sandwiches, to seriously substantial meals that probably throw the Weight Watchers point system into overtime. Come here on a Sunday afternoon and you'll also find a special brunch menu. If all that sounds overwhelming to your waistline, the array of selections on the light ""SkinnyLicious Menu"" is pretty decent, too. I ate a salad from that section of the menu and -- while I initially had to go hunting for the chicken in my tortilla salad -- by the end of the meal, I was sated.  Beverage wise, you'll find just about anything you want. I was really happy with my iced tea. They have three kinds: black, green, and tropical. I tried the green tea, and it was a very pleasant, light flavor, with a hint of mint. Really nice and refreshing. This may sound goofy, but it was a surprise highlight of the meal. I've had the cheesecake before, and yes, it's good. There are about 300 choices on the menu, give or take. So, again -- unless you seriously can't stand (or can't eat) cheesecake, surely you will find *some* option to make your whole party happy.  Long story short -- if you're at the mall and hungry, or if your friends are really eager to eat here, don't worry. You will find *something,* if not many things, you'd like on the menu.

Norman S.,"San Jose, CA",73,402,445,3.0,7/1/2012,"Ah, CF, with the ever present lines for dinner. The only times to come to CF and not have to deal with lines is lunch. The only other time I went to CF for dinner with no line was at the Las Vegas location but I suppose we got lucky that time. As with all CFs, this one has high ceilings and feels huge inside. We got to our tables with zero wait and Service was super prompt and friendly. Typical of chain restaurants, the menu is just overwhelming in it's choice. There are 12 salads to choose from...12! Fortunately, they had my favorite Fish and Chips. Boring you say? Hey, good Fish and Chips are difficult to make. I order it as a Lunch Favorite, meaning a smaller portion compared to the regular Fish and Chips. That's good since (1) it's cheaper at $11.50 and (2) it's not crazy huge requiring a gathering of friends and family to finish. So how good are CF's Fish and Chips? Good, 3-stars good. Not comparable to what I had in the U.K. or Australia but still nicely done. Fish wasn't over-battered, greasy, salty or over-cooked. Just nice flaky morsels of fresh fish coated in crispy batter. Like-wise for the chips. They also had a side of Cole Slaw - julienned cabbage served on a slice of lettuce - had a nice crunch. Oh, mustn't forget the Tartar Sauce which was nice and tangy with chunks of pickles. Didn't go for the Cheesecakes this time but based on past experience, they're a winner - 4 stars.

Both my husband and I were shocked as she said it was ""ok"" for us to pop out. Why was this not told to us before we popped out? We would have been 100% okay to wait in line. Did not bother with even trying to queue again - if service from the counter is this bad, i dont think the meal would have been very much more pleasant.  To take off more stars, the lady at the counter had a permanent frown (even when we first walked in) which definitely sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=520
Raina S.,"El Granada, CA",385,567,340,1.0,1/24/2013,"I had low expectations for this place, but the Cheesecake Factory still managed to disappoint. My daughter and her friend wanted to eat here, so I figured I'd indulge them.  The place was moderately busy, but we were seated after only a short wait.  Our server was pleasant enough, but often disappeared for long stretches. I had a hard time choosing a dish, because there seem to be 500 items on the menu.  I figured a club sandwich with green salad would be a safe bet.  My lunch arrived with a salad that had no dressing at all.  This was actually fine because I used the lettuce on my sandwich (which was also underdressed).  The turkey was dry.  This was one of the most bland club sandwiches I've ever tasted.   My daughter's friend ordered fettuccine alfredo.  She barely touched it.  My daughter had the pasta marinara, which looked decent.  She also barely touched her dish, saying it was ""too spicy.""  Since I love spicy food, I decided to have her leftovers for lunch the next day.  The dish was horrible!  Turns out, it was spicy because the sauce was inundated by undercooked onions.  I think they were rancid, to boot. CF has a nice patio area (though it's not actually outdoors).  While it's quieter than the restaurant itself, I don't recommend you sit here.  The benches in this area are crammed together so tightly that there is no legroom, even for a shorty like me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=520

Jamil M.,"San Bruno, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/17/2015,"When I came there before, the service was great.  After today, I WILL NOT go there  ever again.  The waitress (Danielle H) I had seemed like she wanted to rush, get a tip, and did not use proper food-handling techniques.  I brought a friend from out of state to enjoy the California life and going to the restaurant was unprofessional, unfriendly, and to point that I was ready to go legal with them.  The manager for today was not professional and was argumentative with me, the customer.  This place of business lacks customer service, professionalism, and poorly trained staff including the manager for today.  After awhile, the situation was fixed, however, this type of service is what WILL make people not want to go there again.  Even when I do customer service, I am not argumentative nor making it conflicting and speaking it's business practice.  Regardless of business practice or not, it is not professional and also I wonder because I was a minority that my friend and I was treated differently.  If this country is going to get better, this kind of behavior must stop.  I WILL NOT go there again because the first impression was the LAST impression going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=520

Waited for 30mins, and then server finally came and said it was gonna be extra time and asked if we wanted a complimentary soup with a guilty face. Soup had burnt bacon in it, tasted like leftovers. He probably forgot to put the pasta on the order. Near the end of our meal, a fat guy in a suit, presumably the manager, was apologizing to the table right behind our's.

D C.,"San Carlos, CA",90,130,54,2.0,12/18/2013,"I have a hard time giving this place 2 stars because the food isn't bad, and usually, the service isn't bad, but the last experience we had sort of ticked me off. In time, maybe I can forgive and forget, and I'll revise my rating. Anyway, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for happy hour ($5 appetizers - HUGE portions - from 4-6 pm) and I've always been pretty pleased. On our last visit, we sat ourselves at a booth in the bar area, like we'd done before, and waited for a server to acknowledge us. One walked in our general direction, and then stopped at the computer station... and the minutes ticked by. Finally, 5 long minutes later, he walked over and asked if we were there for happy hour. When we said 'yes', we were told that we'd have to move, either to the bar, or to the tall tables in the bar area to be served from that menu.  Uh, what? We were literally in there a week and a half before, seated at a booth, and scarfing down happy hour menu items.  Grudgingly, we got up and moved to the little 2-person area at the end of the bar that was dropped down so low that we felt like we'd been seated at the kiddie table at a cousin's wedding.  After that, bar service was a little inattentive (probably because we were 2' below eye-level), but the food was still decent, and the prices were, as usual, unbeatable.  Food: Nachos are big, but the toppings can be a little sparse. Corn cakes are like Chevy's sweet corn tomalito, but gigantic and topped with all sorts of saucy, condiment-y things - right up my alley, since I love things smothered in wetness. Chicken sliders are greasy, and mostly bleh. Buffalo strips are again, meh, and the chicken has the weirdest, softest, mushiest processed texture I've ever experienced.

But wait, when the ""Kids Chicken"" came the plate was hotter than the sun (not a great idea to put in front of a 3 year old) and the chicken was harder than shoe leather. We think it was microwaved because the rest of the plate (potatoes and carrots) were tough and jello like consistency. So we didn't even get to eat that. Then our turkey burgers arrived and were drier than the Sahara Desert, but at least they could be eaten by our kids and us, so we shared this.

(I wish I could remember his name, but this was on 9/21/15 around 7:15pm.) He brought us back our two waters and we asked for a few minutes to look at the menu. He came back and took our order. All we ordered was the crab and artichoke dip and a bacon bacon cheeseburger with everything on the side.  15 minutes passed and we were still waiting for our food. Then 20. He came back to our table and specifically said, ""Let me go grab your food for you."" I assumed that meant he was going to the kitchen to get our food for us right? He never came back. Another 10 minutes passed. I had to get up and go over to the registers where I saw him standing and talking to other coworkers and ask if someone was going to get our food because he never came back to check on us. Then he says, ""Oh, yeahhhh you've been waiting like 15-20 minutes right? A manager didn't come to your table? Someone accidentally took your food and they had to remake it. So the manager should be bringing it out shortly."" I then saw someone in a maroon button up shirt (who I assumed was the manager) observe us during the conversation, but he didn't say anything at all while I was asking the waiter where our food was. There were two other waiters around us that checked in with their tables almost 3 times each to make sure they were okay. We sat there and no one came back to check on us.  First off, if you're already acknowledging that I was waiting 15-20 minutes for my food, you should have checked in with us. Second, I wouldn't have cared so much that someone accidentally gave our food to another table and that we waited so long for it, but not once did you communicate that with us while we were sitting and waiting for our food. Third, a manager didn't even come to our table to apologize for the inconvenience, nor did they bring our food out for us like the first waiter said they would.  JP, the waiter who was on break, came back and introduced himself. He was very nice and I actually almost felt bad for him because he had to clean up the mess that the previous waiter left. He ended up getting our food for us and took over the table for the rest of the night.  The one star goes to JP.

I took about ten minutes for the bread to come out, but the waitress said this was because it was just coming out of the oven.  I ordered a Greek salad and my mother ordered the roadside sliders. They were both delicious, and for dessert I ordered the strawberry shortcake. In my opinion this dessert trumps ALL of their cheesecakes.

Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,11/9/2011,"Well, it's about time the Mid-Peninsula has a Cheesecake Factory.  No longer will CF fans have to drive up to San Francisco, Palo Alto, or Santa Clara to fulfill their avocado egg roll, Navajo Sandwich, or their Snicker's Cheesecake cravings. Like all CF's, we expected a long wait, especially on a weekend of its first opening.  We put our name down, given a pager () and were told the wait was 45 minutes.  We were in no rush, so we waited.  At the end of 45 minutes, our pager went off, and we were seated. On this particular weekend, the number of waitstaff was larger than normal.  Some of the experienced staff from the other CF locations were deck helping out the new San Mateo staff.  Our waiter was a young man, very nervous, but personable, energetic, and very attentive. After we placed our orders, we were given the usual baskets of bread. The kids ate the white bread, leaving the whole grain loaves for my wife and I.  The food took a while to come out, but our waiter kept our bread baskets and drinks full. Finally, our orders were ready: -Stuffed Mushrooms: stuffed with fontina and parmesan Cheese, garlic and herbs.  Not bad. -Kid's Penne with Butter and Cheese. Generous portion for a kids item. -Luau Salad: Salad layered with chicken breast, salad greens, cucumbers, green onions, peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and fried won ton sheets,with macadamia nuts and sesame seeds.  Basically a big, spectacular salad, what my wife usually orders. -Four Cheese Pasta: Split order for my oldest daughter and her friend.  Also a huge portion.  Penne, with mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan cheeses, and marinara sauce. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: Shrimp and chicken, peppers, onions in a spicy sauce. Everything we ordered was what we expected from a CF restaurant.  Pretty consistent in quality and taste. The wait for a table and food was long, but that was to be expected.  The service was great. We were too full for cheesecake for dessert, but being in the neighborhood, I'm sure I'll make sure I'll get a slice for two the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=640

Finally, their cheesecakes, oh me, oh my, superb. Their strawberry cheesecake, perfection of course.

Yeah yeah we know you're thinking, ""What the actual f*ck is wrong with you two?! That plus a brunch item?!"" Well we didn't give a crap, and yes we asked for more bread, so carb on!! We had a very delicious experience, and we now sit at home regretting every caloric decision we made, but it was worth it! Our server Justin, was very attentive, friendly, and we both agreed that he was very, very cute lol. To make CCF happy, yes he did offer us cheesecake, but we politely declined (I apologize for calling you crazy hahaha). After all we ate, my personal trainer will kill me.

I'm wondering how long the novelty will wear off and if the wait times will be more reasonable? It beats having to pay for parking downtown SF, so more than likely this will be our go to CF. One small gripe, when we ordered our cheesecakes to go there were quite a few already off the menu b/c they ran out. This is the Cheesecake Factory is it not? I understand there aren't people in the back cranking out cheesecakes up the yin yang, but I know that ish is in your freezer back there.

Cheesecake Factory, the food portions are huge. My friend ordered nachos as a appetizer for us, but we still have a lot left over. This time I ordered the ""Bar-B-Que Salmon"" and that was very good! it`s salmon glazed in BBQ sauce, served with mashed potatoes, corn succotash, & onion rings. The order was fresh and hot, the salmon was cooked perfectly with the BBQ sauce, the mashes potatoes along with the corn were really good, and the onion rings was a nice touch to it. Of course I would never leave the Cheesecake Factory without a cheesecake! I ordered the Tiramitsu! One thing that bothered me, was that I ordered a spiked strawberry milkshake (a milkshake with alcohol in it) & the alcohol was very strong. I continued to drink it, just because one shake is $13 so I might as well drink most of it, but it was kind of hard to do, it just tasted like a regular strawberry shake except its REALLY bitter, ugh.

Second: our waitress (Rachelle J) had this pierce on her tongue, I understand the new youth some times express them selves in a different way then my generation, but eating my food having to sometimes look to that thing was not pleasant at all. Third: My food came incomplete, I order the  rib-eye that comes with fries(i changed for asparagus) and onion rings, when I was almost done came the asparagus, and when I finished came the onion rings, only because I asked for it three times, we also asked for a soda that never came.

Joe M.,"San Francisco, CA",98,87,181,4.0,9/29/2011,"There's a Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale???  Why yes, there is. It's dark, it's crowded, and it's loud.  But aren't they all pretty much like that?  Came here the other night around 630 pm and they said the wait was 40 minutes.  No prob, I'll just walk the mall for a few.  And 40 minutes is definitely better than the 90 minutes you'd have to wait at the downtown location.  Plus, the parking situ is better than downtown as well.  And the wait turned out to be only 30 minutes.  Sweet! Like others have said, the servers can use more experience.  There was definitely a frantic vibe and some things took longer than they should have.  But the manager came by and helped out, and I even saw him deliver some food to another table.  So at least they're making an effort and I appreciate that. If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, it's pretty decent American food served in pretty big portions.  The menu is pretty extensive...They serve burgers, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, seafood, steaks, salads, beer, wine, and brunch on Sundays.  It'd be pretty hard to not find something on their menu to satiate your appetite.  But of course, the star of the menu is the cheesecake.  I mean, you don't come to the Cheesecake Factory and not get a slice of cheesecake.  But food first... In the past, I've gotten the meatloaf, the club, the mac n cheese balls, and a burger or two.  This time I went with the Caramel Chicken:  Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken in a Spicy Vietnamese Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Green Beans, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. It came with rice.  ( )  It was pretty good.  I liked the texture of the chicken batter, and there was enough sauce on everything that the veggies and rice soaked it up nicely.  The serving was pretty big and I could only finish about half of it.  I was saving room for dessert, after all.  The only complaint I have about the dish is that it did not taste the same the following night.  Everything except the veggies was thoroughly dry, and most of the flavor had somehow disappeared.  My advice?  If you think you'll have leftovers, get something that will taste good the day after.  Or, they even have a new ""SkinnyLicious"" menu with a bunch of items for those of us counting our calories. As for the cheesecake...well, we've all tried it before, haven't we?  I mean, they even sell a variety box at Costco.  The slices are pretty big and are served with a mini mountain of whipped cream.  I went with the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  This is made with 2 layers of their original cheesecake, 2 layers of fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream.  It was definitely a chocolate lover's dream.  A glass of milk would go nicely with it. Overall, the dinner and the resto get 3 stars, but I added the 4th because I really like the cheesecake.  The Cheesecake Factory, in general, isn't a place you'd go to often.  But I'll definitely come back if I'm at Hillsdale, have enough time to wait for a table, am craving a slice of their cheesecake, and don't mind walking around with a food baby belly for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=640

He also didn't come back for awhile and again we asked a different server for bread and they gave us bread. After I called him over to ask for water because I was so thirsty. He said yea and then told us their bread is still cooking in the oven, when I told him that another server already gave us bread. In addition so many breads were coming out of the kitchen to different tables. Again it took awhile for my water and we had to ask another server. He then gave us a bill before he gave us the to go boxes. Too much waiting and we didn't get served properly.

A G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,23,2,3.0,9/18/2014,"Sampled a few cheesecakes in a group and as recommended by some other reviewers the Raspberry lemon is truly the best. Tiramisu cheesecake was OK too. Others were too sweet.  The brown bread they bring out for the table along with the sour dough ones are really very good, just by themselves, or with the butter, or with the pasta. The sweet potato fries were really good. Skinnylicious menu is interesting, but then portions get pretty small.  The vegetarian pasta I ordered was OK. Later found out that some other non-vegetarian dishes could be ordered without meat. I wanted to give 2 stars as I found a melted plastic piece in my pasta.

Finally sat down and it took the server another 10 minutes before she came to greet us or even bring water. We were ready so we ordered right away.  This gal couldn't get it together!  I ordered a specialty salad with a regular iced tea.  thinking nothing off it, she took off leaving the menus with us so she can place the order on their POS system.  Five minutes have gone by and she's still at the POS entering the orders.  She finally got some assistance and we waited for our order to arrive. I kid you not, 10 more minutes go by and she still hasn't brought our drinks to our table.  We finally asked another server to please check on our drinks.  A few more minutes came and she finally appears with our drinks.  To my disappointment, I get this horrid flavored tea instead of the standard black ice tea. I called her to our table and asked her again for a regular ice tea and she claims that they don't have any. Their menu claims to have regular black ice tea and she says they don't carry it and that all their flavored teas tastes similar.  Whatever!!!! 5 more minutes go by and she comes back to tell me that I they ran out of salad.  I said excuse me....you mean to say that you don't have any mixed greens, poultry or bacon to make this salad.  These are staple items in a restaurant.  She apologized but I needed to order another dish.   I ordered something else out of frustration and my curiosity forced me to stop another server to question the lack of black iced tea and salad.  To my surprise, this server said yes they had iced tea and got it for me and further proceeded to check on the salad.   She brought the manager over and I expressed my concerns and that I wasn't sure her our was competent.  She apologized and offered to get the salad but low and behold, the food we ordered arrived and I didn't want to waste it Long story short...no compensation other than I'm sorry!  Definitely not a good first impression.  First and last time for me at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=680

Sherene L.,"San Mateo, CA",13,59,34,3.0,10/9/2011,"First off I'm happy that they have a Cheesecake Factory at the mall now, so I don't have to drive all the way to Palo Alto or SF for delicious cheesecake. Since they opened, I've been here twice.  I will have to say that it's worth it coming here early.  FIrst time I came for lunch I got sat right away, the second time I came, I was quoted a wait of 1 hour and 20 minutes...but it actually ended up being an hour and 40 minutes. :( First off, when you get those little buzz electronics alerting you to when you're table is read to seat you, be forewarned that Cheesecake claims that those buzz electronics only work right outside of Cheesecake and to the side where the outside seating is. (I'm sure once H&M opens it, it will work there as well) But not too sure... The two times I came, service was amazing.  The waiter the first time explained some of the favorites and was very attentive.  The second time, the waitress was very attentive and she even offered to split the bill for us before we asked.  Plus, she was able to split the bill correctly the first time without having to write anything down. Although I had some really great experiences at the Cheesecake Factory compared to others, I just felt that they didn't deserve 4 stars.  To be honest, I don't think I'm that old, but the lighting in there was horrible.  Maybe it was for atmosphere or something, but when you're going there for dinner and attempting to read that extensive menu, poor lighting and little font didn't help at all.  I ended up having to use my iphone to read the menu.  And I didn't like how long we had to wait, I don't think almost 2 hours for food that is just decent is worth that time in waiting.   Oh and a friend of mine mentioned it, they have the space to do like a second story or maybe roof top seating, we thought it would have been nice to build that...Always wondered why. If you don't have plans and just want to go for the food and cheesecake, I would highly recommend either eating there for lunch, getting take out, or eating somewhere else, and having cheesecake to go for dessert.  Not really worth 2+ hours wait....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=680

JP O.,"San Jose, CA",4,14,,4.0,7/9/2012,"I guess timing is everything.  This is my 2nd trip to the Hillsdale CF and each time both the food and the service has been really good. Both times - we ate late afternoon / early evening - so not crowded.  Each time - got seated promptly. My girlfriends had Angel Hair pasta with a red meat sauce and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I asked about their meals - both said really good as they finished their meals.  Only about 1/3 of the pasta left - a nice light lunch for the next day. I had the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas.  First - lets talk Corn Cakes - I don't know what to say about these except:  yummy.   I let my girlfriends try them - yummy.  The Stuffed Chicken Tortillas - just as good as expected - the cheese, the sauce, the spiciness, the chicken - just right. We then each ordered a slice of cheesecake - I had the kahlua chocolate cheese cake.   We each finished about half - took the rest home :) The service - very attentive:  took our orders promptly, answered questions about the menu, one of my girlfirends essentially created her own pasta combination - angel hair pasta with a red meat sauce - no problem - handled with a smile.   I have to say for a chain - the cheesecake factory almost always delivers.  You know what to expect - and you get it.  Huge portions, good food - not necessarily spectacular but really good. Can the atmospher be loud - OH yes - sometimes this place is really really crowded.  But it has a good positive energy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=620
Ailly M.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/14/2015,So my wife and I just ate at the cheesecake factory our server was Samantha she seemed pleasant at first I had to ask her for our free bread! When she finally arrived with our bread basket it looked as though she had brought it from another table from customer s who hadn't finished there bread it looked thrown together. Also mind you we are two married women I strongly sensed homophobia from this girl.when she was servicing a heterosexual couple she was telling them to let her know if they needed anything else and if they had any questions. Not once did she give us that treatment. She was superficial in her service. No sincerity at all! This is the first and last time my wife and I will be dining at this cheesecake factory. As for the one in downtown Palo alto quick and efficient service. We normally tip very well but for her service she didnt get what she thought she had coming. I do not recommend lgbt couples to go and dine at the cheesecake factory and steer clear from Samantha!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=620
Andrew M.,"San Carlos, CA",112,65,3,3.0,6/16/2012,"For the money, the Cheesecake Factory offers up decent food and decent service, but neither are just consistent.  Whenever I go into the place, I never know what kind of experience I am going to have. I've had a good experience and I have had one so bad that the manager (who did the right thing in this situation) not only comped our meal but sent us home with a few pieces of chessecake.   I think my biggest gripe about TCF is that for a ""kid friendly"" restaurant (they have a kids menu), they consistently send the food out from the kitchen WAY too hot.  This time, we ordered the little one chicken tenders with fries and the food was so hot that it was scalding to both my wife and I....and the waitress put the food right in front of her.  Luckily I grabbed the food to check the heat, something parents should always do with a toddler, and realize how hot it was, whisking it away from in front of her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=620

The servers were considerate and nice about giving us lots of time to go through their extensive menu.

One reason was because they were open :), but the other would be because I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan for years. This was the first CF I've been too since moving to CA and I'm very happy with my overall experience.  Everything we ordered was delicious, prepared correctly and seasoned well. Now of course we didn't order anything crazy (I went with one of their tasty salads, which are HUGE, my mom went with the meatloaf, which she loved and the bf ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla). Their menu is very large...so there's something for everyone.  Service was great! Our server was very attentive, food came out quickly and price to portion was good.  Parking - since this location is by the mall (Hillsdale Shopping Center)...there's plenty of parking within the mall's lot/garage. Note - make sure you get a slice of one of their many varieties of cheesecake. They are all delicious and huge!

For a fairly new establishment one would think it take years to get this bad... The wait is RIDICULOUS. I'd understand if the wait was actually worth it, but seriously, the taste of the cocktails, the appetizers, the dinner and even THE CHEESECAKE is all horribly sub par. It's basically a giant menu filled with mediocre, flavorless and OVERPRICED items. The pictures are deceptive. It's all a giant disappointment, especially after the long wait. EVERYTHING tastes like it was shipped frozen in a box, then thawed, reheated and served. As a place with the name 'Cheesecake Factory', shouldn't the cheesecake at least be amazing?? That also tastes premade, frozen and thawed (topped with Reddi-whip out of the can). Everything was disgusting about the cheesecake- the crust was like powdered cardboard (texture and flavor) and I could taste the HFCS. You get a much better tasting cheesecake at Coscto. Seriously. At least I know it's baked fresh there... And the whole thing costs the same as one slice here. The only good thing about my experience here was our server- she was really attentive and fast. This chain is ridiculously overpriced... I can't say that enough. Don't waste a dime or your time. For the prices you can get superb food in SF.

Jill R.,"San Mateo, CA",1,14,,2.0,9/29/2011,"One of my favorite casual places to grab a bite.  So disappointed.  The onion rings that my husband ordered were actually swimming in oil.  If we were not so tired and hungry they would have gone back in a second.  The oil (I had a small bite) left a coating on my hands that could only be removed after a trip to the ladies room.  My tuna carpaccio, which I dream about was cut so thick and full of grizzle it was so chewy and disappointing.  I think they even changed the sauce that was promised on the menu.  hummmmmmm.  The last one we ate at was in Palm Springs and the food along with the resort feel was so fantastic I could hardly wait to return.  Now, not so much.  As for the cheesecake we usually leave behind because its more cake than cheese in its huge caloric mass.  It was my 50th birthday and was offered a desert and then was charged for it!  Yikes, can you imagine. Their were mobs of employees but we still had to ask for bread, ask for ice tea refills and although our requests were met as soon as we asked they still managed to all mingle in a huddle by our table full of giggles. That's when our $70 bill came for 3 appetizers and a entree.  Since we live up the street we will try again I'm sure but please Factory, get it together soon and save some $$ by cutting back on your frier.  Those onion rings are awful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=700

The guy in the front told us that we would need to wait for 70 minutes for the seats, we're fine with it so we just waited, after 30 minutes the restaurant told us that there's a table for us, which is great, we were all confused though because the guy said 70 minutes... We went to our table, got our menu and everything; decided what we're going to order.  But the waiter comes after about 15 minutes, after that... Everything is slower than ever... We ordered, finally.  But then it took them 20 minutes, there was about 3 waiters and waitress that came to our table and served us at the same time, which was weird. (we ONLY ordered cheesecakes) and then... we ate...everything goes normal again. My cousin then asked for a box to take out the rest...it took them 15 minutes to get the box... and it took them 15 minutes to get the bills and everything done. We were glad that we did not tell the waiter that it's my cousin's birthday, or it might take about another 20 or 30 minutes just to get the cake and sing the birthday song.

Marty M.,"San Francisco, CA",5,158,,1.0,6/18/2012,"I have eaten at other Cheese Cake Factory locations with much better results. We showed up to the Cheese Cake Factory at 6:30pm and were given the customary buzzer and told that the wait time would be approximately 55 minutes. After an hour had gone by I went to check on our table status and was told that it would be soon and that there were only a few people in front of us. Another 30 minutes pass by and I go to inquire again. She said they buzzed us and that we never responded. I told her that the buzzer never went off and that we were sitting 10 feet away from her in the waiting area. She said she would give us the next available table. I took this to mean that she would seat us next, but she seated us after the 20 people in line were gone.  After we were shown to our table we had to wait for somebody to come and clean the table and seats. There were crumbs and butter smears all over the seats. We ordered our food and it took a little while. The Asian waiter that we had never came by to see if we needed anything or if everything was OK. We had to flag down several other waiters for soda refills, ketchup, cheese, and extra napkins. The food was not hot and did not taste like anything special. We did not see our waiter until we were ready to pay the bill. We did not want to order our 2 cheese cakes to go, because our server was so bad and we did not want to tip him any additional on top of the bill. We ended up only leaving him a 12% tip rather than the usual 20% tip.  We then proceeded to get in line to order our 2 cheese cakes. The line took another 20 minutes. We were at the Cheesecake Factory for almost 3 hours. I do not plan on going back to this location anytime soon.

Jeannie C.,"San Mateo, CA",7,90,5,5.0,9/24/2011,"Wow! This is long overdue for San Mateo, a vibrant American restaurant that will accommodate any palette. They are situated at the south end of the mall with plenty of parking. It is impressive that on opening week they were able to maintain the quality of food, outstanding friendly service, and upbeat atmosphere with people having a great time.  As you enter the restaurant, the bar is situated in the center, to the right there are seating out in the mall area, to the left there are outdoor seating facing El Camino. The restaurant is grand but still feels comfortable and welcoming. Their regal décor makes this a warm cozy place to eat. We ordered Chicken Madeira, sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese. Miso Salmon served with snow peas and white rice, sadly the rice was not warm. Our guest ordered Chicken Piccata served with mashed potatoes and Carlton salad served with grilled chicken. The chicken was moist, salmon and salad was fresh. It was just a perfect evening.

Shauna S.,"San Francisco, CA",149,904,19,1.0,10/1/2011,"Let's get this out of the way, the food is good. I had the SkinnyLicious Veggie burger and it was tasty. The Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip was also good, though they can stand to give you more pieces of sourdough bread. Where they really loose stars is all about the service. Which is just short of dishearteningly terrible. Yes, there's a lot of people (who lack manners) and an awful lot of kids running amok however it's part of the mall atmosphere so I can't knock them for that. But. My party and I order drinks and one appetizer -- the drinks arrive and then the waitress lets us know that someone else will be taking care of us for a bit (for what I assume would be her break or dinner). They leave and then after a while the second waitress takes our orders and then leaves. She came back to check on us and offer more bread to which we ask about the calamari that we've already ordered and apparently that order never went through. So she puts in an order of calamari for us and brings us more bread. A server comes out with calamari and serves it to the other table. Our second appetizer and our entrees come out now and naturally we're still wondering where the first appetizer that we ordered is. It's somewhere, but not here so they request another order calamari to be brought out to us. By now, we're done with our meals however we are told that a manager would bring us our calamari.  The calamari arrives after we have everything boxed. No manager in sight. Yeah, it took about 45 minutes before a manager finally came out to see us stating that they weren't told that they should have seen us in the first place. So now we've got cold calamari for dessert, no one showing us a dessert menu and everyone pretty much afraid to come near our table. After we turned down dessert and coffee (because let's face it, it's now 1.5 hours later and I see no reason that we should spend any more money here) the bill takes a while to arrive -- the manager has comped us the appetizers and drinks. Sure, I could forgive them had they just apologized upfront for the goof. I could have overlooked a lot of things, but the fact that this was so poorly managed from all people is just ridiculous. They may have tasty food but I might suggest that you get it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=700

Then she came to my table and just asked for drinks and left right away. She didn't even let us order any appetizers (we already knew what we wanted to eat too). Then we waited around for 10 minutes for the drinks to come and right after she settled the drinks down, she just stood there with her pen and paper and didn't say a word to us. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and were like uhh ok. Then we ordered and she left. Our appetizer came out and 30 minutes later our dishes came out. There were a few other tables that sat a good 30 minutes after us and got their food right after us. And my boyfriends food was cold and the chicken was rubbery. We also noticed that every table around us left before our food even came. We were so disappointed because she didn't even check up on our table or anything.

Pete T.,"San Mateo, CA",1,35,,3.0,4/4/2014,"Ugh....I refuse to go to Cheesecake Factory any more. The last 2 times I ate there, they made us wait in line for over 30 minutes even though 1/3 the place was still empty claiming they weren't staffed enough. THIS IS A TACTIC that many chain restaurants take which is similar to how night clubs make people wait in line to create an atmosphere of demand and popularity. Then, when we wait, the servers are hustling, but they are clearly understaffed. It takes 10-15 minutes of hailing servers to get the bread basket and a meal took 90 minutes. My kids are very easy going, but 90 fricken' minutes after waiting 30 minutes even though restaurant was not full for a 2 hour meal at the Cheesecake Factory?! Ludicrous. So recently, I went with my 7 yr old and they told us 15-20 minutes wait. We waited, and waited and after 25 minutes they told me only 5-10 more minutes. My patience was already boiling and I knew it would be a 1 hour+ wait to even get the food. WE BAILED. We ate at BK in the food court instead for $10, and with all the money we saved not eating there, we bought ourselves some jelly beans and gummy bears, got a Hello Kitty item and a couple cookies for dessert. What a great evening. No thank you Cheesecake Factory, I am never coming back because your service sucks. Food: 4 stars - I think the food is solid, and they give good portion. Great cheesecaske of course and their bread is phenomenal. Pricing: 3 stars - decent value restaurant and reason why people go there. Service: 1 star - they suck. The servers and hostesses are fine as it's not their fault. It's understaffed EVERY TIME I've been there (5+ times in last 2 years), and they purposely make you wait in line to get seated even when they are not full. Did I say their service model sucks?

The server was for the most part attentive although it did seem that she had some other things on her mind, as she overlooked things sometimes. She was great at getting our refills and did check in on us frequently.

Ellen H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,229,121,3.0,8/28/2013,"The food tasted good and service was prompt- but the portion sizes have become much smaller compared to other Cheesecake Factory! We (party of 2) were seated quickly on Sunday around 1 pm. Ordered crab cakes appetizer, which were very tasty but way overpriced for three small (2.5-3 inch diameter) crabcakes. Came with 2 tasty similar dipping sauces (mayonaisse/rach style with herbs). I got the factory combination (steak diane and chicken maderia), which was delicious, but again, the food was at least 25 less than what I've received in the past. (And they don't offer a lunch portion for the combination so it's always $19.95.)  Usually it comes with a giant mound of mashed potatoes but this time I got three small scoops. The piece of chicken was smaller.  My sister got the dinner portion of a bistro shrimp pasta but the plate was smaller and the food was level (none of the usual mound of pasta). As always we enjoyed the complimentary honey wheat bread but we were still hungry after eating our entrees. With the food, a strawberry lemonade, and a coffee, the total for two for lunch came to about $75 including tax/tip.

Would of wanted to get our order in earlier, but understandable. Daniel, our server, was very attentive during the meal. Refilled my soft drink when it ran low and checked up on us several times. Good server. EXTRA: My guest was under the weather so we ordered hot water with honey and lemon. Does the trick for a sore throat when out and about. ""Guacamole Made-To-Order"", medium ($10.50) with chips for starters. -Next time, remember to have the chips warmed. -Not much of a bite for medium spiciness. May step it up one level next time. -A bit pricy for what it is, but you do get a lot. ""Bistro Shrimp Pasta"" ($17.95). - The shrimp was prepared nice and crispy. -Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce wasn't too sour or salty. Just right! -Parmesan cheese on the side to regulate the soaking and taste effect since it is a large dish. -Pretty big portion, especially after being served the warm bread and chips. NOTE:  The servings are quite generous for 2 people, so consider shopping around mall before coming back for one of their famous cheesecakes. Anticipate taking leftovers home if you don't have a big appetite. A pleasant dinner experience. 2nd time at this site. Would go again and recommend this place to others.

When I pointed that out, they finally printed off our seating ticket. Then they lost it before we got seated, so we ended up waiting for another fifteen minutes. After having them find our name three more times we finally got our table. The waiter was helpful and attentive. The food was a big letdown however. It was bland and tasteless. I had a pasta dish and it was pretty bad. It had a lot of oil in it but with very little cheese, cream, or garlic.

Jordan L.,"Belmont, CA",44,1,,4.0,8/8/2013,"I may be a little bit biased since I am an ex-employee, but if anything - the fact that I don't completely hate this place should really say something about this Cheesecake Factory. There are several things on the Cheesecake Menu that are worth talking about, but my three all-time favorites are the Miso Salmon, The Orange Chicken, and the Gumbo. All three of these dishes are spot on when it comes to taste, portion, and presentation.  The Miso Salmon, which I recommend to get in the lunch size since its 6 bucks cheaper and is roughly the same size, is a typical Asian-style Salmon with a delicious glaze of something that resembles Teriyaki sauce and a Miso-based sauce. Tastes great every time. The Orange Chicken (lunch size) at this Cheesecake is cooked to perfection with an excellent blend of Crispiness and juicy chicken. With a side of rice and vegetables its a simple, yet delicious plate. Lastly, the Gumbo. A new-found favorite! I tried this dish after trying many Gumbos from other restaurants - Kingfish being one of them, and man did this one stand out. The New Orleans classic was an amazing blend of spices and flavors that was served extremely hot (temperature), which is how it should be served. I had it with white rice, but used a whole loaf of sourdough and rye bread to help me take down this massive plate. I was only able to finish half. As for the Cheesecakes, I personally can't handle extremely sweet items, so I would recommend the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake or the Vanilla Bean, those ones are better suited for the sweet-sensitive eaters like myself.  I give this a 4/5 stars for the delicious food and amazing service (depending on the servers - most give amazing service).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=740

Food was good. Second time, we arrived after 8 pm and wait time was not more than 20 minutes I had the pulled pork sandwich Apple cheesecake, service was OK. We got our appetizer at the same time as our meal, so we had to send it back.  Third (and last time), wait was about 40 minutes. Finally got to try the pear and blue cheese flat bread, this was yummy. And it arrived on time, before our meal. I had a shrimp and veggie pasta meal and the macadamia nut cheesecake. The service was OK. But both my husband and I got sick that night. He ordered the Salisbury's steak, so I am not sure what made us sick. I did notice that the wait staff is very young, sometimes this is good because they're energetic, but I worry about cleanliness.... I really wish they had a ""No Flash"" policy for parties, we got blinded throughout our meal and I know our neighbors did too, because a large party on the other side kept taking pictures and the flash was so strong it looked like we were in the middle of a lightning. This also happened on our second time there. I know a large party brings lots of money in a bigger check, but atmosphere should be pleasant to all.

I am a common visitor of the cheesecake factory and have visited a number of locations through the state and one in another one and so far since this had opened in September, the service and food has been acceptable. Since this being the cheesecake factory, the quality of service could vary depending on the moods of the servers as well as the night visited based on the number of customers that had decided to dine in that evening. On several occassions I've found myself order such dishes as one of their delectable steaks, or a specialty pasta which would be accompanied by appetizers such as macaroni and cheese bites, nachos, tex mex eggrolls yet as far as the korean bbq tacos i didn't care much for those. Ending the night with a slice of their signature cheesecakes is a must have, yet don't be suprised if the total by the end of the night sends a chill down your spine since being the cheesecake factory, shouldn't suprise you that it'd be quite pricy so plan on going if your looking for a fancy night out and not if your just looking for a place to have a lovely dinner at an economists budget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=760

Alicia F.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/18/2015,"I used to really enjoy coming to this cheesecake factory until my experience this past friday. I came for my friends birthday and there were about 7 of us and my other friend and I decided to share a meal, the salmon and shrimp scampi combo plate. They bring out the dish and we cut it in half and the whole inside was completely raw. The waitress apologizes and takes it back and makes us another plate. They bring the second one and there for the second time, the salmon was raw on the inside. She leaves us the mashed potatoes and the three shrimp and just takes the salmon. The manager comes up and says they usually don't cook it fully because they don't want the salmon to be dry?! I have never heard of that before in my life. We finish our potatoes and shrimp and when they brought my friend her birthday cake, they brought the third piece of salmon, which wasn't perfect. I was really disappointed and to top it off they charged us for the meal, I would not feel right about paying for such a poor meal so they took it off and then said next time if you don't want it, don't eat it. Incredibly rude and one of my friends even new another waiter who worked there and he told us our waitress was talking crap about us.

We ordered stuffed mushrooms, Asian chicken salad and moroccan chicken. We also had the red velvet and peanut butter cheesecake. All of which were pretty good. No complaints there. Why the 1 star you ask? Well for starters, our server, NHINA, was very rude. The whole time she spoke she acted stuck up and acted like she didn't want to be there. When she brought out some bread I asked her if she could get us more sourdough bread. I waited 10 mins for her to tell me they were still baking so I had to wait. Ok that's fine, I waited. We were done eating and she packed out good and she still hasn't brought more bread like I asked. I didn't mention it again because I feel as a server these are things you need to remember. She also never asked how we were doing and if the food was good like normal severs would do. She never checked up on us. Horrible customer service. I wished we didnt waste our money here.

We ordered couple of appetizers- calamari and crab cakes, after 25 min of waiting I asked our waiters if the appetizers are coming, she went back to the kitchen and brought only the calamari- they were hot and yummy. After 5 more min the manager stopped by and apologized that the crab cakes are taking so long and offered to pay for them.  10 min latter we got our main course, but the crab cakes were still missing. We were almost done with our dinner when they arrived and they tasted horrible, soft in the outside and very mushy in the inside.

Dani C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2014,"I going on the record to say that cheesecake factory is one of my favorite places to eat out with friends and family. There food is amazing and they have huge portions. But the service at the Hillsdale location is a load of crap. Having crap service a few times, I can let it go. And by a few times I mean anywhere from 3-5 visits. But after that, something needs to be fixed. I'm not picky and I guess that's why have let so many bad services just brush off my shoulder. But today was the last straw. I work in Hillsdale mall at one of the stores and because I like Cheesecake factory, I have a menu to the restaurant. I know they are busier on the weekends, so when I know I'm going to be taking my lunch break, I call in advance 20 to 30 mins before so that by the time I take my lunch the food is ready. Today I called at 3 pm, and was placed on hold. Which is normal because they have to transfer you over to takeout. At most, you're on hold for about 4mins. Not today, they put me on hold for more than 10mins, and at the 10min mark, I decided to use another phone and call them again to ask what the deal was because no one was picking up the takeout line. the person on the phone apologized, put me on hold again on the second phone and I was hold for another 3 mins. I had 2 phones going on hold, and they never answered the original call I made. finally they took my order, which was a mushroom burger. Simple and easy. The girl who took my order told me that it would be 15-20mins and they would deliver it to my store, so I wouldn't have to come get. I said cool and paid the bill over the phone. Now all I had to do was wait, which meant that my food would be at my store by 3:35pm at the latest, which was the grace period she told me. 3:45pm rolls around and no sign of my food. Now because of the grace period she gave me, I waited to the last possible minute to clock out for lunch, because when you work in retail, you only get 30mins. I had to clock out for lunch at 3:30pm and my food should have come by then. So I call them back at 3:45pm to see if something happened. What I was told was "" sorry, but we got a little busy, but I have someone bringing your food right over"". I said ok, I still have 15 mins left in my break, that's enough time for me to eat and be back in time to work. So I waited and waited and no one showed up with my food. So I had no choice, my lunch break was over and I had to clock back in, hungry and annoyed. Finally at 4:05pm, the food arrives and the first thing that comes out of the girls mouth is sorry about the wait but here is your burger and I just need the card you used to pay to get the card number. I give here my card to copy down and I tell her in a calm but stern voice that I am disappointed with the service, and that all they had to do was call me to tell me that it was busy and I should come get my food. You had my cell number and my store number, a quick call was all I needed. Don't offer a service with a time frame and not hold your end of it. All she could say was sorry and left my store. Not 5 mins later after she left, I get a call from cheesecake. No message so I called it back to inquire what they needed, they had delivered the food(cold and soggy) and I had paid when I ordered the food an hour previous. When the guy answered the phone, I told him that I had gotten a missed call from them and no one left a message and his response was ""I don't know, maybe someone in the bakery called, did you order something?"" I ran through the situation with him of what happened and that I had finally gotten my food, and all he said was"" sorry about the wait, on your next visit with us that won't happen and that I hope that this experience wont effect my decision to come back to there establishment"". I proceeded to hang up because I was beyond frustrated with him and the staff no owning up to there misgivings. Saying sorry doesn't fix things. I never asked for anything other that to provided the service that was told to me on the phone when I ordered my burger. Not once did I ask for a discount or something free due to there crappy service even though with everything that happened, should have been offered. After hanging up on that call, 10 min later, I get another call from them, so I answer. According to the woman I am talking on the phone with(by the way, she was the manager on duty) the girl who wrote down my card number forgot to write down the expiration date. I literally wanted to jump through the phone because I was so angry. How hard is it for people to do there job. So I go get my card out of my purse for the third time and give her the info. I proceed to explain the whole situation again to the manager and all she says is sorry, and that we got busy. Guess what, I'm a manager in my store and I get busy to and if you have people waiting for you the least you can do is just keep them informed. It's not that hard. So I am officially done with The Cheesecake Factory in Hillsdale mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=840
Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",60,13,4,1.0,10/2/2011,"Very disappointed=\ Pros: -The Cheesecake is yummyyyy!:D Cons: -Waiting time is way too long (need to start doing reservations, or be more organized) -Waiters are slow -Should be more considerate off all the paying customers. -Bad music (can barely hear it anyways.=\) I've been to the cheesecake factory in SF and in Palo Alto. Average waiting time would be 45-60 minutes which is fine because I know its a popular restaurant and it also allows you to walk around while you wait. Both places had excellent service and food. On a busy day the noise level was quiet enough to have a conversation with a person sitting across of you. The music was calming and there seemed to be a good classy flow.  Now let me tell you about my first experience at the hillsdale location. It was my birthday yesterday(10/01) and I was really looking forward to having dinner at the cheesecake factory. I arrived there at 5:30pm. There were heaps of people gathered in the front of the restaurant waiting and there was the waiting line to get a table. In the beginning the girls at the counter were nice and informed me that it'll be a 1 hour and 30 minute wait,...OMG!! Im patient, but that just seemed ridiculous. I dont like the fact that we can;t make reservations! They seriously need to change that. Maybe it'll be more organized if they did. So we shopped around for about an hour then waited infront of the restaurant for a half hour..I walked back in and asked why they didnt buzz me in..they informed me saying that it'll take another 20 minutes and that one more party was ahead of me. Thank goodness I brought my crazy impatient mother with me because after that extra 20 minute wait she had to demand them to seat us(btw it was just a party of 3 ppl!!...3!!..). They had skipped us and let all the other parties into the restaurant except us! We were the only ppl waiting outside in the cold wondering where everyone went. and we could obviously see many vacant tables inside. We basically waited over 2 hours!! They either need to replace or train these ppl better.. Now once we get a table our waiter immediately gives us our menus and drinks. He seemed very nice but he was making everything so rushed. We barely got to look at the menu! :( they didnt bring us the bread but we noticed they served some ppl that came in after us with bread and drinks. Its like they totally forgot about us!! the food was decent,. i was hoping for something better but I didnt get the chance to read much of the menu. i just ordered whatever i ate last time:P These waiters need more training and they should NOT gather in groups and talk too much because they made us wait sooooo long for the check ugh!! When they;re on their shift they should be there for the customer not to chit chat.  Besides the wait and the service the noise level was waaayyy too loud. there was a group of girls celebrating a birthday and they were yelling and screaming loudly. now i can't blame them only. of course everyone is talking within their table/booths, but these girls were too loud. We told one of the waiters and they said they couldnt do anything. We werent the only ppl that complained about these loud group of girls. After awhile I noticed that the manager was going table to table apologizing about the noise..he went to every table ..except ours!! WOW!! that's pretty rude. I've been to enough resturants in this country and other's..but this has to be the biggest disappointment. I always saw cheesecake factory to be a great place to have a date or hang with colleagues or friends or fammily..but after last night I dont think i want to ever go back there. Hopefully they'll improve=\",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=840

I LOVE CHEESECAKE!!  So glad to see the Cheesecake Factory open closer to home, no more trekking to PA.  On our latest visit w/ our daughter and in-laws we had an interesting experience.  We got in after the normal 15+ minute wait, no problem.  GREAT waitress got our drinks/orders and bread. Then we sat, and sat and sat for almost 45 minutes, which is NOT the norm here!!  We called the manager over and he explained that they had a power outage a little while ago and were running w/o computers so they were a little backed up.  No problem - we just ate more bread until our food came.  After our food finally came, a couple things were not right so the manager came over again, apologized and offered to take some dinners off our tab for the inconvenience and bad experience.  Usually you get offered a free dessert or something that you weren't going to order anyway, so we were VERY happy that he offered that, it def made up for the bad experience.  Cory Willis was the manager and should be commended for his customer service during a hectic time.  We will for sure continue going to CF and know that as long as Cory is there we will be taken care of if there is ever a need.  Thanks Cory!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=860

P D.,"Encino, CA",0,37,3,2.0,10/6/2014,"I should have read the reviews on this location before coming in and not based my expectations on my neighborhood location. The restaurant was about 2/3 full and the first table I was offered was directly in front of the bathroom -seriously at the entrance to the bathrooms. The hostess seemed surprised I didn't want to sit there. The next table was located by the bar which was much better. My server came about 10 mins later and asked if I needed anything else -- he seemed to think I was the last person that sat at the table. I was then given another 10 mins to decide what I wanted only to find out that they were already out of my appetizer at 6pm. He did bring my beer quickly which helped. Then I realized that I was not offered the bread basket one usually gets before my food arrived - no I never received it. My waiter buzzed around but seemed to forget I was here only stopping by once until I was ready for my check which I had to flag him down to get after passing by me at least 6 times. The food on the other hand was typical Cheesecake Factory fare. All I can say is if good, or decent service is a factor for you, save yourself the disappointment and pass up this location and go for Mexican at Fernando's like I should have done.

Fine.  Then someone came to the table and said that the salmon hadn't been prepped the night before and that it would be served hot. Fine.  My salmon came and the mango came in a dish on the side -- diced into tiny pieces with the skin on.  In case you haven't had mango, it has to be peeled.  Eating mango skin is like eating banana peel.  I asked them to redo the mango.  Then I cut into my salmon.  It was raw.  I asked them to cook it more.  The manager came over and apologized and said they'd comp my dessert (they should have comped my entree).  They served the salmon again.  I got myself clean silverware and cut into it.  Still raw.  I called the waitress over and asked them to broil my salmon for 5 minutes.  Finally it was cooked.  I got up and got myself another set of clean silverware and ate it. It was fine, not great, but I was starving.  I told them it was my friend's birthday so they'd put happy birthday on her dessert plate.   That didn't happen.  I got the bill and was charged for both desserts.  I called the waitress over and explained the problem.  She said she'd have to talk to the manager to comp my dessert.  Really ???

Mia K.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/1/2012,"Other Cheesecake Factories are great - this one is soooo bad it's almost laughable. First impression - sign in area is absolute chaos!  Several employees talking to each other with their backs to the customers and no organization as to who is first in line.  Then they say ""the wait will be 2 hours 45 minutes"" with a straight face hand you a buzzer and turn away again.   Once seated, the waiters ""overtalk"" and  interrupt your conversation- they often have 2 waiters (one trainee). Been there 4 times - each time they got the order wrong.  Then they expect a tip by handing you a bill and saying ""thank you Miss Jones"" because that is the name they see on the credit card.  Like that is going to help. Twice they were out of Red Velvet cheesecake and the waitress recommended it - once the cheesecake was frozen solid and had to be sent back.

Atanu R.,"San Bruno, CA",64,42,5,2.0,8/13/2015,"So I'll begin with their service. I reach the restaurant at 2:30pm when the hotel is near empty. A condescending lady ""greets"" us (if u can call it greeting) and asks us to wait. Remember that the hotel is near empty now. So she asks us to wait for 10 minutes.  10 minutes passes on to 30 minutes. In the mean time I request them to provide us just with a set of seats since my parents were having problems sitting in the reception area. But it fell on deaf ears.  So at 3:00pm(or thereabout) we get our seats. Once seated it takes another 15 minutes for a server to show up. Remember that the restaurant is near empty. And everything from thereon takes excruciatingly large amount of time to happen. Now lets talk about food: First they serve us their customary free breads. In other cheesecake locations it tastes great. And they come out directly from the oven. Not here. + Sourdough is missing. Bad bad bad. We ordered  Fried nachos, pasta, cashew chicken and pizza. Each of them (except pizza) tastes BAD.  Now for the good part. The cheesecake here is good. The ones we ordered are  Mango key lime and Tiramisu. Both of them tasted good.  Advice: If you are hell bent on spending your money here, please ""take-out"" the cheesecakes and run as fast as your legs can carry you out of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=500

Larion S.,"New York, NY",91,91,547,3.0,9/6/2013,"Just like any other Cheesecake Factory you've been to. Pretty standard and nothing that differentiates this place from the others. Don't get me wrong though. This can definitely be a good thing. Familiarity makes knowing what I want and what to expect much easier. Food is solid. I really like the lunch menu options because they're not too large (so you don't get a bloated, full feeling afterwards) and they're reasonably priced. I also really like the salads (I tolerate salads, so for me to say I really like a salad and would order it again means that it's pretty good). And... well... the cheesecake is what it is. Large, rich, and delicious. But my favorite part of every Cheesecake Factory I've been to is the complimentary bread and butter. I can practically have that as my meal and I'd be content. When the waiter/waitress comes and asks that one question... I don't even have to think about it anymore. My response is automatic. ""Would you like some more bread?"" ""YES, please!"" In short: Food: B+ Service: B to B+ Price: B Positive(s): + The complimentary bread (they may as well just give me 5 baskets right away) + Food is standard and no different from other locations. Still pretty solid. + The location. The nearest Cheesecake Factories are either in Palo Alto or San Francisco, so having one in San Mateo is convenient. + If you're into shopping, the mall is right there. + Lunch menu (I think this deal is the best priced option on the menu) Negative(s): - Some of that stuff is expensive. - Service can be slow and inattentive. - Wait times for seating and service can get especially bad during peak hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=500

Terri B.,"San Mateo, CA",14,9,,2.0,1/16/2012,I have been waiting for the Cheese Cake Factory to arrive to the San Mateo area for years. I am a huge fan of this restaurant. The menu selection is very large and the food usually good. Unfortunately this new restaurant at Hillsdale isn't getting high marks from me. I was there a few days after New Years Eve day and a friend ordered the Lua chicken salad. I have had this salad dozens of times at other locations and love it but this had dry and unedible chicken in it. In addtion we had asked to see the dessert menu. Upon our waiter coming to take our dessert order he informed us that they were wiped out on most cheesecakes and the selection was very very slim which was disappointing. Instead of telling us what 6 cheese cakes they did have on hand he told us to keep asking him and he will check it against his list of non available cheesecakes.  Is this NOT called the cheese cake factory?? I always rate a restaurant by the cleanliness of not only the eating area but on the bathrooms cleanliness as well. The women's bathroom was a mess and 2 of the stalls had no toilet paper in them. Mind you this was at 12:30 noon time which says to me NO ONE stocked the bathrooms on the closing shift the night before. I just tried this same restaurant for dinner last night and AGAIN the women's bathroom was not stocked and out of toilet paper in stalls and a mess. I think management has some problems to work out here. The next time I get a craving for the Cheese Cake Factory I think the Palo Alto location will be my choice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=880

The food was ok. Not great but just ok. I got the garlic noodle hoping that it taste something like the garlic noodles at ppq or thanh long in sf but it soooooo didn't take anything like it or had any garlic taste.

Considering the fact that they weren't taking any reservations, I made sure to call in about 3 weeks prior and asked to talk to the manager. I was hoping she would be able to accommodate a big party such as this at least in some way. She assured me that if we arrived by 10:30 am and were all there that we would be able to get accommodated pretty quickly. Taking her word, my party and I arrived right on time. After a few minutes of waiting, the manager came out to tell me that we would not be seated until 12:00 pm. That did not fly so well for my party and I, and we asked if we could work something out. After offering her many options and her not budging, we finally came to an agreement that we would be seated in the bar area at the high chairs and would start off with some appetizers while they would set up the regular tables for our party. An hour and a half into it, we were still not seated and the elderly people at my party had to leave early because they were so uncomfortable sitting at the high chairs.

I could get a good orange mandarin chicken dish but then the cheese steak could not be as appetizing. Still, it is a good place to have dinner or a lunch with the friends as it has plenty of seating and is quite busy. It basically makes up 50% of the business at Hillsdale Mall. The cheesecakes are the highlight since it is their namesake. I can order any of the cheesecakes from their menu and be filled. The service is decent but can be a little bit more attentive. I understand it gets really busy but if you put all your attention on the big table, the small table is the one that gets neglected and is also the one that could give you the better tip.

Vivian P.,"San Francisco, CA",25,8,,1.0,10/11/2012,"We've gone to this restaurant several times in the past and when we went to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday, I was very shocked at my whole experience.  Here they are: 1. I asked our waitress when they would be serving bread and butter.  We were a groups of about 22 with 7 young children so we were hoping to get bread right away so the kids had something to nibble on while waiting. She responded with a little annoyed tone in her voice, ""We have to serve all the drinks and get all the appetizer orders first.""  The bread and butter was brought out about 30 minutes after we had been there and 5 minutes before our entrees were served. 2. My daughter ordered a hamburger well done.  After several bites, she noticed that it was not well done and mentioned it to the waiter.  The waiter requested another one.  She never got to eat her hamburger because they didn't bring it until we were done with dinner.  She was given a comp cheesecake for this mishap.  Who likes leftover hamburger the next day? 3.  When the appetizers were brought out, the waitresses were asking who ordered what.  There was a bit confusion, and the waitress threw the plate down on the table. 4. The last time we were there my husband ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  It was so good when I tried it that time, that we both ordered it again.  I had initially noticed two larger shrimp and the rest were small salad size shrimp.  My husband's shrimp were the same size as mine, small, and his brown rice was over cooked and crunchy.  My daughter's boyfriend also ordered the shrimp and when I asked him what size his shrimp were, he told me they were all this size - as he had one on his fork which was the same size as the two larger ones that were on our plates.  I mentioned this to the waitress.  She told me that when they don't have the larger shrimp, they'll compensate by giving a lot of smaller shrimp.  The shrimp was the size that you top salads with - SMALL.  The manager came over and told me that they cooked our plates with the wrong shrimp and were giving us two brand new plates to bring home. Needless to say, we'll never go back there again.  It's overrated, crowded, and customer service is less than sub-par for a big group.  BTW, we still tipped the waitress/waiter when we really shouldn't have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=880

I dont want to go into details because there are too many things that happen that night all I can say is that this place sucks and that I am warning people not to waste there time or money. Manager if you get to read this use ur  skill to stay open and have your staff cheat chat less and work more and please go to training .

Quick S.,"Burlingame, CA",0,39,23,1.0,10/9/2011,"This place has not worked out its kinks and is definitely not a place to bring young kids.  Although they have a kids menu, they do not have anything to keep them occupied while waiting.  Our wait on a Sunday evening was 1 hour to be seated which was expected since they just opened recently and the Cheesecake Factory has a good reputation elsewhere.  Once we were called, we ended up spending the next 2 hours there.  It was freezing cold as the AC was cranked up.  Luckily, we had extra clothing for our kids to change into to keep them warm.  It was therefore very uncomfortable for me to eat there. The waitress took our drink order right away and we told her about the cold temperature.  She said she would tell the manager but it would take an hour to feel any difference.  We later told the manager (Carl) who was very attentive.  We didn't see our waitress again for about 15 - 20 minutes.  She then hastily dropped off our drinks and took off without taking our order.  She then came back 10 minutes later to take our order.  We must have waited 30 minutes for our food and with 2 young kids, that is not easy.  My husband could not get his food at the same time because they overcooked his pork chop and had to make it again.  The manager immediately came out to apologize and offered an appetizer or soup.  Another 20 minutes passed before he got his food and then another waitress came by with another meal while he was eating his first one.  They did the same thing with his lemonade earlier.  The manager offered some complimentary cheesecake for our bad experience which we accepted.  Although the waitress took our dessert order quickly, we didn't get it for quite a while (not unexpected) as our waitress was chatting with the couple at the next table for 5 minutes. The food is OK but certainly not worth spending 3 hours of my time.  I will not be back any time soon.  The staff needs more training and experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=900
Catherine R.,"Macedon, NY",0,49,27,2.0,4/29/2013,"I've found this CF to be declining. When you go to a CF anywhere in the country, you're supposed to know exactly how your meal will be served -- they are very consistent in preparation. I always get one of two choices: the teriyaki chicken or the filet mignon. I ask for the chicken to be boneless, and dozens of times that has meant three smaller boneless, skinless breast pieces. Delicious. Occasionally, it's not prepared the same way. Last week I instead received two giant breasts with the skin. Once I removed the skin, the breast meat was blah and tasteless. When I order the steak, I stress ""no pink"" and suggest that they butterfly it. Still, I've had to send the steak back a few times because it's pink. Also, the seasoning is inconsistent. I notice that the restaurant isn't as packed like it used to be and wonder if others are experiencing the same decline. Some servers are eager to please and have the manager talk to you.

David C.,"Burlingame, CA",2,49,,2.0,1/1/2013,"Went to CCF on the 1st  day of the year.  Was with a party totaling 8 people.  Initially told we would be seated at 7:35 pm a 45 minute wait.  No problem as CCF does not accept reservations and it was pretty busy.  At  8:00 we had not been seated, I asked the hostess, she said they were setting our table.  At 8:15 I pointed out our table to the host, she said they had run out of clean silverware and it would be just a few more minutes. At 8:25 we sat down.  Quite a few menu items were not available, obviously the restaurant had gotten slammed on New Years  Eve and had no deliveries on New Years Day.  Our waitress had to return to our table three times to advise something we had ordered was no longer available.  Calamari and most salmon dishes  were unavailable.  Overall the food was fine, comfort food is usually pretty simple and tasty.  I had the Shepherd's pie, it is always tasty.  The drinks were fine.  table service was a bit slow, in the past this waitress had done a pretty good job but tonight things just were not running smoothly.  We waited for quite a long time just to see her to ask for to go containers.   One desert I asked for she said was seasonal and no longer available, I advised her it was in the cold case in front of the store and still available.  She accepted our order for another cheese cake, vanilla bean  only to come back a few minutes later to advise it was no longer available.   My point it this, CCF is a big chain and should have an understanding of what to keep on hand year to year, someone screwed up as they seemed to be out of quite a few items, wait staff seemed slow and confused as did the host.  They just did not have things in order tonight.  I will return, I hope they clean up their act, have enough staff on hand to handle the crowd, wash the silverware etc.   Also, the mandatory tip for parties of eight or more is BS if they cannot handle the group in a satisfactory manner.  It was over 15%, I think it is either 16% or 18%.  I don't mind leaving 20% but expect things to run smoothly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=900
Only The Blunt Truth A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/30/2011,I had my comment removed before due to its content regarding employee issues instead...well it's my feeling that what's going on within a company does extend to its customers.  Due to what I do know I no longer eat at the Cheesecake.  There is alot of disrespect in the kitchen amongst the workers and I wonder if the customers ever hear it.  They're mainly young Hispanics cooking and it appears they don't like the Caucasians they have to work with.  Cheesecake also states they pay up to $13 an hour for line cook but really hire on people at $9 and less.  They also don't get their benefits until after working for 9 months and some 600+ hours before they can even see any medical or dental coverage.  Don't think this has nothing to do with how the service is or how the food comes out of the kitchen because IT DOES!!!  I'm tired of hearing of the harassment and cussing going on here.  Management needs to rid of the perpetrators and the workers who don't show up or are hours late to work before I think professionalism can be and in turn be shown to the customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=900

The service is, like everybody else is saying, sloooowwww. And yes our waiter disappeared on us too. Went there last night, Thursday at 7 pm, found a table in the bar right away. Waited for menus.  Waitress at table next to us was taking orders, collecting menus and walked away not bothering to hand us 2. I got up and picked them up from front desk, inpatient me! Normal wait to place order, no appetizers just entrees. Drinks arrived and we waited and waited for food. 3 different employees showed up over the course of about half hour, saying it should be out any minute. Hah! Finally I got my pork chop, my daughter had ordered the petit filet with French fries but only got the filet. Fries came 15 minutes later after she was done. They were very apologetic and offered us free cheesecake but since we're both not a fan of cheesecake we declined. Both our meats were cooked to perfection, my pork chop came with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach, delicious. And can't complain about the waiter except that at one time he disappeared for about 15 minutes. Break? I know it just opened and I think I'll wait a month or so before I go back until everything runs smoothly. I kept thinking of Chef Ramsey and ""Kitchen Nightmares"" that's what this whole experience reminded me of. The whole dinner took almost 2 hours.

Now, the only reason I gave them 3*'s is because the servers need more training.  Some have attitudes, orders were wrong, wait time is horrible, some can't multi-task, and each time I have gone there I had to flag down my servers to get things, even when it wasn't packed.  They should be more proactive and ask if you need anything.  One person who was serving my table left (on lunch or break not sure) but another server had to take over --guess the old server didn't communicate they were leaving.   The table next to me had waited over 30 minutes just to place an order.  There was one server I can't remember her name but she was on top of it!! When I go back, I will get her name and post it here as she should be the role model for all -- super friendly, visits your table several times, gets things as soon as you ask, etc. and always had a smile on her face.

Location- Outstanding addition to San Mateo, Hillsdale Mall in particular. They did a great job with the outside décor and landscaping it really gives the place an extra appeal. I love the enclosed outside area which has giant windows that they open up on nice days to turn into outdoor enclosed seating. I've sat outside there for a Sunday Brunch with the family and it was a great place to enjoy the sun with great food and great people. Yes, they have a Sunday Brunch menu and yes like everything else the food is amazing. Services- I've now had the chance to order take out twice and both times have been a hellish affair. When you first turn into the parking lot you will notice they have about 5 stalls designated for Cheese Cake Take Out but they are always full. So that leaves you to drive around aimless trying to get a parking spot near enough so the employee's can locate you. Both times the food was not ready at the designated time and we had to keep checking up on the status eventually my friend had to go inside and get it.

Then the server came introduce herself ""Demian"" ask us what we wanted to drink pretty normal stuff we said thank you, she didn't reply took our order came back with our drinks then i say ""i think we are ready to order now"" she reply with an attitude ""I'm just dropping off your drinks"" walks away puts the tray she carried the drinks with somewhere then came back and looked at us with a pen and pad without saying anything so I'm thinking to myself i guess its time to order now. She took our orders demanded the menus back. We were all like whats her problem. Food was served brought over by other staff members. She comes even before we get a bite in and say hows everything without waiting for reply walks away. Our waters wasn't being filled we never got a your welcome all the times we said thank you. And then on top of that i was tired of dealing with her shit cause i obviously realize shes prolly not happy with her life soo i didnt want to deal with her at time. She comes ask us if wanted dessert we order a slice for my little nephew bday. Wife and cousin and two youngest kids went to bathroom the server comes with the cheese cake and says oh there not here (my nephews mom) and says lets just sings just take lots of pictures. Mid happy birthday my wife and cousin comes back, song ends the server didnt apologize or anything or even suggest to sing ago. Long story short our experience herr was horrible! The server was obviously not happy with how her life was going and decided to take it out on her customers! From reading most of the comments on this cheesecake factory just reassured me of how i felt! Will not be supporting this place ever again! I rather wait 3 hours for a table at union square location then experience that kind of service again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=660

I've come here on a my lunch break often and this past Monday topped it off. We ordered a few appetizers, and we then realized an hour had passed and we had not received anything!!! The server walked by and we asked for a manager who looked 18yrs old dryly apologized and said he'd go check. No thanks, we got up and left. CHANGE YOUR MANAGEMENT!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=660
Abhishek K.,"Redwood City, CA",2,37,,1.0,1/25/2015,"They seem to be hiring waiters with mood swings. When asked for a couple things ( plates and butter), the bartender Justin made a weird face and banged his hand against the wall. The manager was apologetic, but looking at other reviews here, hope they try to give service some importance. And hire people who belong to the service industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=660
Chris W.,"San Francisco, CA",12,35,1,5.0,9/21/2011,"They just opened, so I was not expecting a lot.  There wasn't really a huge line, so we got seated fairly quickly.  The decor is very similar to their other locations.  Even the restroom door handle is the same style.  It's impressive that they can maintain that level of consistency and branding. They have two different IPAs on the menu and they gave me the wrong one.  They swapped it out but would have been nice to keep both so I could compare.  Drunk yelpers tend to write better reviews.   I asked how the pork chop was, but the waitress hadn't tried it yet.  I know there are a lot of items on the menu, but maybe part of the training is that staff should be given samples of the food they serve.  I took a leap of faith and ordered it anyway.  Our friends started to get their food and I was starting to wonder where was my food.  Someone came over and said there was a delay with my pork chop b/c someone burnt it.  They comped me a soup, which I thought was nice of them.  When I initially ordered the pork chop, I was concerned whether or not it would be dry or not.  After hearing the news about the burnt one, cognitive dissonance was kicking in.  When it did come out, it was moist and perfect.  What a relief. One of the managers also came by our table to check in.  I thought that was very good of them to do that. I would have normally given a lower rating given the experience but b/c of the comped food and manager follow up, they recovered gracefully.  It gave me a feeling that they really cared and I was rooting for them to succeed. Since I wasn't familiar w/ the layout of Hillsdale Mall, it took me awhile to find the restaurant.  I entered the mall in the middle coming from the Caltrain station.  There was no directory at the entrance so I wasn't sure if I was even in the right building. I had even tried searching on my phone for ""Cheesecake Factory Hillsdale"" and only found news articles discussing the move in.  There was some scant mention of the old Mervyns location so that lead me to believe it must be physically connected to the mall since Mervyns probably used to be one of their anchor tenants.   They need some better SEO. When I walked further in, I did finally see a sign pointing to ""Restaurants"" but that led me to the exact opposite side of the mall.   It was at that end of the mall where I found a real directory and was able to locate the Cheesecake Factory.  Better signage please.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-san-mateo?start=660
