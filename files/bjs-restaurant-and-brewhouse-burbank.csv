Em K.,Seattle  WA,86,198,107,11/16/2017,5.0,I think this place would be a great place to take your parents or in-laws! They serve a variety of things  everyone is sure to be happy :)I've had their pasta and thin pizzas and have been very happy with both!
Adriana R.,Van Nuys  Los Angeles  CA,224,220,274,11/25/2017,1.0,Oh BJ's. I loved you in my youth. Many high school and college memories involve your pizookies. But you just do not stand up to the test of time.First of all  this location has valet parking for $4.50 and they drove my car two parking spaces to park it. That annoys me. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table and they didn't even seem that busy. Once we did sit  our server was nowhere to be found  CONSISTENTLY. My husband ordered the prime rib special and that was a mistake. The prime rib was incredibly over cooked and dry  and the sides were lacking in flavor. I had the BBQ deep dish pizza and it was also bland. We then ended with a chocolate chips pizookie which I was SO SURE was going to be amazing  because it's a hot cookie with ice cream  so how can you mess that up? Well it turns out you can serve a lukewarm cookie and it kinda just kills the whole vibe. Also  because of the slow service and disappearing waiter  the whole meal took over 2 hours. What a waste of time and money.
Jerald R.,Sunnyvale  CA,149,1,2,11/7/2017,1.0,Absolutely horrible. I placed my order via DoorDash and received an email from DoorDash stating the restaurant had confirmed my order at 6:37p. Delivery was scheduled for 7:41p. And at around 7:46 I wasn't even showing the dasher at the restaurant so I texted to be sure everything was okay. They said they were picking it up. I contacted customer support and the dasher texted saying the restaurant claimed the order was never placed and it would be a few minutes. By then it was 8p. 20 minutes after it was supposed to have been delivered.The customer support rep tried calling the restaurant and was placed on hold for an ungodly amount of time while my poor dasher was stuck waiting there. Finally the rep gets back with me at 8:40p and informs me the restaurant is not even going to fill the order  and that the dasher said there were many people waiting.TWO HOURS after I placed the order and an HOUR after it was supposed to be here. My dasher waited at the restaurant for over half an hour - i wouldnt even have to wait that long for my food if Id gone there to eat in person!!!IT'S a TUESDAY night!!! Even in person on a weekend - no matter how busy you are I would never have had to wait 30mins after i ordered let alone TWO HOURS to receive my food.Absolute shittiest service. DoorDash was nothing but helpful  and I've never had a problem with them - but to have you as a restaurant tell me you wouldn't even FILL the order after all that?Absolute Shit.
Andrea A.,Burbank  CA,47,37,5,12/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,UPDATE- I have reached out to the GM who responded to this three times without a return phone call. I am keeping the corporate office updated  and they seem to be taking this very seriously. What a disgraceful way to manage.
Steve W.,La Mirada  CA,409,79,185,12/2/2017,4.0,Came here for lunch. Valet parking was awesome and super fast. Used the app and were moved up in line to get seats  and even placed our entire order online while waiting to hear seated. Had our food in less than 10 minutes and enjoyed an incredible lunch! Service was outstanding too!
Lena P.,Ontario  CA,21,482,1384,11/5/2017,4.0,Our waiter  Hunter  was amazing! We had a huge party of 25 and he managed our whole table by himself and did the best job I've ever seen in managing a large party like this. He was always polite  happy  energetic and always there when you needed something. 5++ stars for Hunter's customer service! The food was good  BUT...they did mess up on my tavern pizza  it had meat on it when it wasn't suppose to...but it was sent back and taken care of. Although the new pizza I got was still wrong  as it was missing other ingredients  and I didn't want to send it back for the second time  so I just ate it as is. The pizza looked like it was thrown together very messy...their line cooks need some work!Their chocolate chip Pizookie is always good and so is the monkey bread!
Stevi B.,Los Angeles  CA,145,94,123,11/7/2017,4.0,Being from the east coast I had no idea what BJ's was.It's actually pretty good! They have amazing portions and great drinks.Just like any chain restaurant if you been to one you have been to them all so you will never be disappointed on the food. That's a promise!They have pretty good drink deals as well! You can not leave without getting the dessert!!! Soooo good!!!!
Wendy Y.,Central LA  Los Angeles  CA,25,3,5,11/4/2017,5.0,Love this place!!!My favorite is the club sandwich with a baked potato. Too bad they didn't have potatoes this evening so I got fries instead and still was delicious...For dessert my daughters love to order the Pizookie it's so delicious.
Loren R.,Anchorage  AK,9,233,242,9/2/2017,4.0,"Wings. Got the traditional buffalo Great flavorOver cooked on my opinion  dry...ishNot a meal  it\'s a light meal sizeSmaller wings. Sweet potato fries too salty for me. Yet they were a welcome option and would order them again. Friendly bartendress. ""Mika ""very personable and positive. Beer glass never stayed empty. Food order on fast. I\'d probably try something else on the menu( tomorrow) before doing the wings again. They weren\'t bad. Just not something that would draw me in the door. But if you have a hankerin\' fir wings.   get em.Love the relaxed atmosphere.------------Next day. Ordered the deep dish pizza. Rebecca. The barristress   was attentive and pleasant FYI  owners of restaurants. Re: business travelers/ single patrons I sit at the bar because I can:Get attention fast Get beer fastNot wait for a refillOrder food fast. Pay fast And get to my hotel and get to sleep. NONE of that happens at a table. None !Also  not all barkeeps get that. Rebecca nailed it. Food order and beer order in   in 30 seconds Second beer on the way as I finished the firstPaid and potentially out the door in 30 min. Deep dish pizza. 4.5 stars. I\'d prefer more cookin  to get the cheese crusty on the edges. ( didn\'t get that) and more brown on the corners of the veggies ( nope)Still I\'ll starve myself again to order the pizza here again. I\'ll just ask for a few more minutes. Thanks Rebecca And thanks BJ\'s"
Jak Leroy D.,Hidden Hills  CA,108,150,259,7/19/2017,5.0,We love BJ's! We come here at least 3 times a month and every time is perfection. The servers and bartenders are all very personable and hard working and the food is awesome! Whenever we're craving pizza and a pizookie  we head over to BJ's. The best pizza is definitely BJ's Favorite and the Classic Pizookie is a great meal ender. For appetizers  I recommend the Beets with Feta  the Sliders  and the Root Beer Glazed Ribs. Can't go wrong!They also have an awesome Happy Hour Monday through Friday 3pm-7pm.
Ashley A.,Los Angeles  CA,236,122,2,10/6/2017,1.0,I ordered a salad and specifically said no feta cheese  I'm vegan...cheese was sprinkled in  out and around it. Either someone was being passive aggressive or just doesn't do directions. That's kind of scary to operate that way and work in the food industry.Thx  BJ's! Unbelievable.
Kevin C.,Denver  CO,13,85,18,10/19/2017,5.0,Who doesn't love BJ's? Great menu with plenty to choose from! Everything we ordered tasted excellent and the service was excellent as well!
Bree N.,Burbank  CA,510,151,166,9/14/2017,1.0,Came here after class to continue my son's birthday celebration. This time  joined by more family. Everyone ordered something different and shared. I wasn't crazy about anything. Not even the Pizookie. Oh wait- the beer was great. I mean  but that's the point  right? You come here to enjoy a beer and watch sports in a clean restaurant setting but the food appears to be secondary to that. The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the service was good. Despite the subpar food I would've given this place a two to three stars. But halfway through my son's birthday pizookie he found a long straight hair embedded in the cookie (Did not match the texture of anyone at our table). We notified the server who apologized and offered to replace it but we were over at that point. Just gross. Won't be back.
Melissa Z.,Glendale  CA,0,10,,11/10/2017,1.0,This particular BJ's sucks. Hostesses are dry  our waitress was more hyper than a fruit fly. She had no concept of communicating with customers. It took a really long time to get a pizza and Caesar salad that was below average. Let's say I'm not impressed and will not be returning.
Valentina S.,Los Angeles  CA,106,298,818,4/24/2017,4.0,In downtown Burbank  there are several decent sport bars to watch games but most of these bars do not have their own parking  so you gotta park in a public parking and walk at least 10 min to a bar/restaurant; however BJ's has its own parking (self-parking and valet parking) and you don't have to deal with any parking problem.The food quality is the same as other BJ's which I'd give 3.5 stars for the food and beverages. The service is decent and ambience is good in this location.Overall is a cool spot for watching a soccer or basketball game with a group.
Caroline S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,12/2/2017,1.0,Been here twice. The first time I wasn't impressed but tried to give it another shot this time around- turned out to be an even worse experience. Ordered a pizza  a piadina  and pastas....Food came out lukewarm at best  it took almost an HOUR for our entrees to come out.... lost our appetites  decided to pack it up and instead of coming back with enough boxes  the server had to do it in 3 trips  even with bags. I empathize with servers especially during busy hours  but the whole experience was just disappointing. Food was horrible though and soon as I got home  had to yack. If you're planning on a corporate restaurant- go elsewhere. Too large of a menu with less than mediocre food.
Alexa O.,Los Angeles  CA,1,7,12,11/25/2017,1.0,I had the WORST experience at this bjs with my friends. We came in a larger group (12-15 people) for my friends birthday and our waiter whom resembled josh from drake and josh was EXTREMELY RUDE and INCONVENIENT. He fat shamed my friend for ordering two meals and judged her for the amount of food she was eating and made her feel bad. This establishment then took over two hours to bring out all of our food and then when my friend accidentally spilled her drink trying to reach food from him he became extremely annoyed and angry. He then CHARGED US AN INCONVENIENCE FEE of $45 all because he has a rude temper. I will post a photo of him.
Cassandra Y.,Burbank  CA,5000,1330,8881,2/4/2017,3.0,The Service: Super super super slow on Friday night. It was packed!! It was tough to get good service. Our server was always no where to be found. The food was served 30 minutes later.... The Parking: Valet parking or self-park. Just let the attendant knows  they will guide you where to self-park. If parking lot is full  you can park across street  public parking lot (free)
Edgar O.,Los Angeles  CA,200,44,9,11/18/2017,1.0,Let me start by saying I have never waited 50 mins to an hr when ordering food  then I get my soup which was klam chowder I ask for Tabasco and crackers never got my crackers and my Tabasco took forever to come then me and my wife order steaks she gets hers well done mines medium well and let me tell you they both came rare  then we have no napkins no utensils like really how are we going to eat just plain horrible experience I had to ask for utensils and napkins then later on I ask for water omg another 30 mins just plain horrible experience never will I go to this BJs and I will tell all friends and family to definitely avoid coming here by any means necessary.
Chris G.,Las Vegas  NV,45,122,150,10/12/2017,2.0,"Wow! Insert said face here! After a long day at universal studios ( private party )  we decided to chill back at the hotel and grab some food to go   luckily ( we thought ) bjs was right across the street ? We placed an online order and were awaiting a confirmation email as it said one would be arriving soon ......after a minute or 2 no email arrived so we called they said they received order   so I started walking across street   upon arrival there was no one at podium or take out area and I was told by other guests who were waiting for take out as well that the girl would be back I went to restroom to wash up and coming out still no one who worked there  after a few more minutes the girl came back and brought out the other guests food and apparently my order  which was quoted as 15/20 minutes from the time we hung up the phone at this point it was only about 10minutes from hotel  waiting and bathroom break   the takeout girl asked if I was picking up and I gave my name and she says order was ready   I was ""wow cool!"" Than she says that we were just waiting on the queso dip  I did place an extra order for milk and extra pzookie  which she said should come out together  once again cool  she said it was just going to be a moment after a few minutes the manager came out and said they were out of queso   and if I would like something else because they were closing soon  I decided on spinach dip   then she said it would be out soon then after a few minutes more I got spinach dip and pzookie  the girl forgot the milk and I had to wait a few more moments for that ! By the time I got back to room about 35 minutes had gone by   for an order that was mostly ready when I got there !! Wtf ?? Anyway back at the room  we opened food that was either cold ( spinach dip and sliders ) or burnt ( pzookie)   there was no ketchup for fries and all in all it was a very disappointing experience !! My friend called the restaurant and was told by Agatha the night manager that there was nothing she could do because they were closed already ! For the most part at the Henderson NV restaurant   I totally enjoy my BJs experience but here in California this left a lot to de desired !!"
Jem K.,Irvine  CA,3,122,325,7/30/2017,2.0,Came here around 430 and they said 10-15 min wait. i looked around there were alot of empty tables. So we just assumed not alot of servers to cover the whole area. So we waited and waited and waited... and we finally got called after 30mins.:) Food:Great white Deepdish pizza 14in. - dont expect Chicago deep dish. It's ok. a bit salty. Enough to feed 5 people with 2 slices for leftovers.Avocado roll - my favorite dish! 2 rolls had the spicy taste to it.. some just had plain avocado. i remember it being really good but today it was ok. I mean... i'd order it again.. today just felt off maybe?Calamari - crunchy good ol' calamari. Deep it in marinara. Yum.:) Shrimp and asparagus pasta - bland. we smothered it with cheese and crushed red peppers. Had like 3-5 pcs of shrimp? Dry and a bit undercooked. Will probably not order this again.TIP: if you download their app and use mobilePay... U get to free mini pizookie! My other favorite!:) Park in the structure if you dont want to do valet
Suekay D.,Santa Clarita  CA,38,39,37,11/18/2017,2.0,Service was horrible to say the least. Food was decent  basic would be a good word use. Our order was wrong so that was a bummer since it took over 25 minutes to get out food. Highlight was the pazookie that was good.
Christine L.,Los Angeles  CA,837,519,1381,10/3/2017,5.0,The staff here is outstanding!!! They are great at accommodating my food allergies & gluten intolerance. The Pazookie is awesome. Food is good and we didn't have a wait.
sue b.,San Jose  CA,0,19,,11/24/2017,2.0,Wrong choice for dinner tonight. Service was seriously lacking and the prime rib was the worst I've ever had.So many choices in the area and we definitely made the wrong one.
Lorie N.,San Jose  CA,82,112,627,6/14/2017,3.0,Spacious space. Food is similar to other BJ's. Cool and familiar American food and beer.
Amy S.,Los Angeles  CA,75,146,22,11/19/2017,4.0,Good service  good pizza  and of course  their Pizookie's! This location in particular is great because while people in the lobby were waiting for tables to open up  they served a couple pizzas to us! Free of charge :) A great way to make you feel welcome. I'll be coming back to this location for sure (and not just for the free lobby pizza)! I've got to try the holiday Snickerdoodle Pizookie!
Mona T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,,9/22/2017,1.0,BJ's has been a favorite restaurant of ours for years. The food flavor is excellent. However the service consistently is slow from the front door through to the kitchen. It took 1 hr and 30 minutes to get our food once we sat down.I'm saddened!
Chris D.,Bakersfield  CA,22,239,327,9/12/2017,3.0,Well the reason I gave it three stars instead of five we had to wait 35 minutes to get a table but looking around the restaurant there was at least 17 tables empty we did have a server that was training another server which I didn't mind the service was a little slow getting refills was alone most hard to do unles I flag somebody down the food was good and their parking is a little small but they do have valet parking for four dollars if you want to pay that
Kae M.,Burbank  CA,1,25,5,9/10/2017,1.0,Another chain restaurant that is going downhill quick ! Pretty soon it's gonna be trying every gimmick in the book to get customers back ! I decided to give them a try tonight after a 3 year break and I was quickly reminded why I stopped coming here .Service --- Slow   no refills   took 15 mins just to take our drink order   waited over 25 minutes to get the check ! Food --- buffalo wings that most likely came from a freezer bag .. Pizza had the smallest amount of cheese   I couldn't even taste it or see it ! I don't know why I decided to give them a chance again tonight   but never again ! Lesson learned
Singris B.,Burbank  CA,38,37,23,9/4/2017,1.0,I used to frequent this location  but within the last 2 years my 3 visits were a bit disappointing. FOOD: the quality of the food is nothing like it used to be  I used to order the Parmesan chicken or fettuccini Alfredo  they were made to perfection  and ALWAYS hit the spot. Well not anymore! Not sure why the Parmesan chicken has dry tomatoes sprinkled over it now  still a bit pink and bland! The mashed potatoes used to be covered in a delicious sauce  not anymore. It seems like they cut back on a lot  especially the warm delicious complimentary bread and butter they used to serve. We were super hungry so we ordered bread to eat while we waited. cost (5.99)  but our food got there first! So it was pointless and we canceled it. The grilled chicken pasta  is not what it used to be. It taste like pieces of chicken that were frozen  warmed up and tossed over pasta. Not the fresh off the Grill tasting chicken Over a creamy Alfredo pasta I remember! I won't get started with the pizza =( WAIT TIME: took way too long to get our food considering it wasn't busy. We were seated right away  and there were plenty of empty tables. How ever  it took about 40 min to get served! And when you have a 2 year old with you  it seems like an eternity! The waiter seemed like he could use a break  it Took way TOO long to get our drinks/refills.Not sure if I'll go again  but if I ever do  I'll update my review if anything changes.
Abbiegail S.,Atascadero  CA,151,115,79,5/7/2017,3.0,Food was great! Especially the avocado egg rolls... which are to die for! But the reason I'm giving the place 3 stars were because we waited 15-20 minutes on our drinks and there was a mixup on our salads. I asked for shrimp on the walnut salad and my friend asked for the salad with fruit (no meat). After eating it halfway through  I realize the salad I was eating was hers but with shrimp and the salad she was eating was mine. We didn't want to say anything after consumption but the chef should have given us the correct orders. With that being said  food was still delicious and I appreciate the waitress' effort despite the drinks being held up. She was great in every other way and was very sweet and friendly.
Andrew P.,Long Beach  CA,132,334,746,11/19/2016,5.0,My friend & I had a great experience yesterday with our server  Adam. He was very friendly and efficient with us and we were glad to have him take care of us. Originally we were seated by the smaller bar in a smaller 2-top booth  but we were uncomfortably warm sitting there so we asked if it was possible to move to a different spot (in which case we were moved to a bigger booth close by with a much better & comfortable temperature. We were told about the 2 for $25 deal so we pursued it and Adam was very willing to explain what we could get. We ordered the 2 salads  a medium pepperoni w/ jalapeos and bacon  and a Cookies N' Cream pizookie. All of it was amazing and it only came out to $25 plus tax. Of course had to get a pitcher of their delicious Brewhouse Blonde Pale ale so our bill came out to roughly $47 or so. I was a little disappointed in finding out that I wasn't credited my BJs rewards points as I had asked  but maybe I will contact the restaurant in hopes to getting them back  haha. Definitely a good location for BJs. Luckily for us  the place was not that busy on a Friday night at 6 or 6:30 (I was surprised)  but later on it filled up quickly.
Frank M.,Los Angeles  CA,15,4,,11/6/2017,1.0,I have a hard time giving a bad review. But I was so excited to have dinner here and even more excited about the pizookie. Today is the following day and my stomach is still in pain. All of our entrees were awful  tasted like rubber and cold and stale. Lemon chicken tasted like rubber. Pasta and meatballs were disgusting. And at the end I was excited about the pizookie. It came out cold. And hard as a rock. The service was fine  but the food was awful.
Claudia D.,Los Angeles  CA,22,13,55,8/10/2017,1.0,BJ's has always been one of my favorite restaurants but the experience at the Burbank location disappointed me. I'm sorry to say that the Parmesan crusted chicken was not prepared in the same way that it is prepared at other locations. Lemon cream was cold  poorly blended and inedible. The rest of the meal was ok. I don't like to complain about service butThe valet parking is unnecessary and the staff seems overwhelmed. The greeters were talking and appeared bothered that I had interrupted them. The person that served my table was just ok. No smile  seemed upset to do the job and never asked how my meal was. The bartender appeared upset as he was loudly throwing ice and glasses aroundBad energy overall.
Darrio C.,Sylmar  CA,25,17,19,11/12/2017,3.0,Great location great food excellent on Sundays it's crowded so the service is not the best but the pizza is worth going back for
Nancy N.,San Fernando Valley  CA,69,129,144,3/20/2017,1.0,"Went here with the bf since he got a craving for a Pizookie. It was a Sunday night and the wait time was only 15 min which was great! So far so good. Once we got to our table  that was a whole different story. We were practically ignored and had to flag down anyone to place our orders  to ask for a refill  to ask for our ck and to ask for a bottle of ketchup that ACTUALLY had ketchup in it. We actually ordered more than what we originally said we would order. We opted for burgers and fries  chips and salsa  sadly no beer since it was given up for lent. ""our waiter"" was tending a bigger party next to us and we kept seeing him come back and forth tending them the whole time. We literately sat there and stared at him to see if at any time he felt us looking at him. No more Pizookie cravings I said. Next time we\'ll make that sucker at home  unless we go to a different BJ\'s. Management: If a waiter has a large party or a few large parties and then they have a few parties of 2  send someone else to help him or her. The smaller parties will definitely be ignored."
Janice B.,Burbank  CA,24,2,,11/11/2017,3.0,They are super busy in the weekend my burger came with just lettuce I ask for tomato and onion I got one slice of tomato and a ton of onions they waiter laughed ask he brought it to me also service was very slow waited 25 minutes for desert menu . Super slow service
Denise R.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,1,10,,10/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Since the manager reached out  I emailed back to resolve the issue. 3 months later  and nothing. Just so you know  I'm waiting...
Candace B.,PANORAMA CITY  CA,190,270,2547,2/19/2017,4.0,OMG!! The best clam chowder sourdough bowl I've ever had. Now  it took forever to come out because the bowl is freshly baked but trust me it's worth the wait. All the food was delicious tonight! The clam chowder was full of big juicy clams and so creamy. The chicken picatta was lightly breaded  perfectly seasoned and had tender juicy chicken on the inside. The fish and chips were crispy and flaky and not salty. I didn't take a pic but he calamari is always good and the hamburger sliders. My only complaint root bear flavored boneless chicken had a weird taste. Would not order that again. We ate so much we had no room for dessert but if we did  it would be the pazooki. It was packed and originally told it was a 40 minute wait but only waited 13 minutes. Our server was nice. Good night all in all.
Adis Z.,Burbank  CA,2,20,11,9/15/2017,5.0,I love to eat in BJ's. I visit BJ's at least once every week or every two weeks. We went to this restaurant on 9/14/17 and were helped by Nick the waiter and honestly We got the best service ever. He is a cool guy. Very professional. Friendly and super nice. Food was good like always. Restaurant clean and full at 5:00 pm. Thank you Nick for your service. I hope you get raise
Marc C.,Toluca Lake  Los Angeles  CA,0,10,,10/23/2017,1.0,"No stars deserved!!What\'s the point of having an app or offer to give customers the option to order online if every single time  countless times  the food is never ready  ""oh  it says pick up time  but that\'s actually the time we actually receive the order to start preparing."" After long day at work and having to have your dog wait in the car since the expectation is to go in and come out with paid for order. Instead having to wait at least another 15 to 20 min because of an error they are already aware of?? And in the past you call several times to confirm they have your order and are working on it  but constantly getting placed on hold and no pick up."
Crystal C.,Van Nuys  CA,16,42,48,10/8/2017,1.0,The service is horrible! It took us an hour and half maybe even more to get our food. We didn't even end up eating and took our food to go. I used to like BJs because of the dessert but it's hard coming back here . Our waiter didn't even come to our table to give us refills and couldn't even clean up our table . I'll just stick to TGIF
Brian A.,Encinitas  San Diego  CA,0,13,,9/9/2017,2.0,Slow service on a slow night with plenty of staff! Red flag should have been the fact the place was empty on a Saturday night. We had to ask them to put the SC/Stanford game on TV. Now mind you  I'm a UCLA fan rooting for whomever is playing against SC  but how clueless is the management/bar staff? Your restaurant is in Glendale which has a huge SC fan base!Oh  and by the way  kind of doesn't look too professional for one of your employees to take her break in the bar area eating In n Out while another one sits next to her  talking on his phone with his bag of Cheetos in front of him!
Rowen H.,Las Vegas  NV,42,102,303,9/8/2016,3.0,"I tried the Sirloin Steak that came with two sides. For my sides  I chose the Tomato Bisque and Skinny Fries. The steak was mediocore  nothing too special about it. I thought it was actually a bit too dry (I did get the medium well) but it seemed like it was well done because some parts of the steak was burnt. I really enjoyed the tomato Bisque and their fries were also really good. For $15  I thought it was well worth it. Service was really slow. We asked our server if she knew what the letters ""BJ"" stood for (we were not trying to be gross) and her response was ""it\'s not what you think it is..""She actually had no idea what it stood for so my friends and I ended up looking it up online. Anyways  I thought my experience here was average. Try it when you are in Burbank  CA."
michael r.,Glendale  CA,42,87,,9/30/2017,1.0,I dont know how I even ended up here.. but Mark the. Manager does not honor any Promos that Bjs play on national tv. Next time Bjs...hold the sausage...
Brandy J.,North Hollywood  CA,0,4,2,7/6/2017,1.0,This was absolutely the WORST experience I have ever had at this location. Three meals two came out but I had to wait 20 minutes before my meal was brought out. One of the sandwiches was raw and my ribs were so dry. I have not even started on how poor the service was. What is worse  the table behind us were seated 10 minutes after we ordered and they finally got what they ordered as we were leaving. #bjsbrewhouse
Jen R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,10/12/2017,1.0,horrible experience! my family and I went out to dinner to celebrate my nephews birthday on a Friday to leave very disappointed. Food took over an hr to come out and when it did my medium well steak was dripping blood! I was so grossed out ! waiter literally only served us one round of drinks when we asked for a refill it never came. ZERO STARS if I could! Oh and to top it off our appetizer came out once we were done eating !!!!
Thomas B.,Burbank  CA,12,72,8,7/2/2017,3.0,The food was ok but service was not great. No cutlery. We had to ask for it. Lighting was Too dark to read menu. During meal  not one plate or glass were bussed off the table. When the bill came it was just a printout...no faux leather folder or anything. Just the bill. Just as we are about to leave they take plates. I don't know if that's their policy but I don't like to eat surrounded by plates.Might try another time. Maybe we came on an off night
Tab A.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,75,7,4,6/29/2017,2.0,We have had really enjoyable experiences at the BJ's in Santa Clarita and Glendale  but Burbank? No bueno. Poor customer service  filthy bathrooms  and rude management. Restaurant critic Elmer Dills always said that if a restaurant's bathrooms (which are public) are filthy  you can bet that the kitchen will not be any better.My personal opinion is that the poor customer contact  neglectful table service  and dirty premises at the Burbank location is most likely a reflection of bad management (the staff trying their best under poor leadership). The manager was condescending and dismissive. We will return to Glendale and Santa Clarita  but definitely not to Burbank.
Cris I.,Burbank  CA,623,424,6046,6/24/2016,4.0,Buy One Get One Free Entree for Premier Rewards MembersI had been here several times already in the past but came back here for the promo. Who would say no to a BOGO free offer? Not me so I'm in for another visit and tag along a coworker to share the promo. We were promptly greeted and led to our table. Although there were several tables in the front  we were assigned a table to at the farthermost section where the bar is so we requested a table nearer the main dining area. They obliged without any objection.We ordered a salmon quinoa bowl ($12.50) and a chicken pesto pizza ($15.50). The salmon was crispy on the outside but juicy in the inside. The quinoa and the vegetables were also perfectly cooked. The same goes with the pizza which came with chicken  tomatoes and artichoke. We really enjoyed both the meal so we finished them all.The restaurant is huge and has many tables divided in different sections to give privacy to diners. Customer service is always great every time I come here. The only reason I took off one star is the issue with valet parking. I would fully understand if there's limited parking but on the contrary  there is a huge inside parking lot. As a matter of fact  cars are just parked near the entrance. I believe that parking should be free to customers as an incentive for patronizing the business.
Liz O.,Glendale  CA,199,19,13,1/4/2017,2.0,I used to love coming here for parties  games and beer. Uuummmm never again. Came to have a family dinner. Party if 3. The wait for a table was not too long. 15 min on a Wednesday night. Got to our table. Took 22 min to be waited. Finally our waiter came...I asked for the Santa Fe Spring Roll...he said they don't have that on their menu anymore. #FailSo we just ended up ordering our food. 48 min later we get our food. Sister and I got pasta....it was cold. Sister felt like she was eating chicken Alfredo's pasta cold soup (See Photo). My Penne Pasta plate was cold too. I was not a happy camper. Waiter wasn't all that great. Checked up once in the 2 hours we were there. I say 2 hours because the first 48 min we waited for our food. Guess they actually killed the chicken and made it from scratch.This menu change is garbage and I definitely will not be back here again.
Sean S.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,2,5,2,9/28/2017,5.0,First  let's talk about Max our server. At first he seemed a little shy by his body language and that was perfectly fine. Then my Girlfriend and I soon found out it was his first day and the whole house was packed. I knew from previous occupations that the first day is the day that makes or breaks you. To my knowledge  today being busy was the perfect opportunity to make him a great server. He kept the drinks flowing without even asking and told us about the daily specials they offered. Overall  and I'm speaking to the owner reading this  he did great. Thumbs up max  I appreciate your hospitality and I'll definitely be coming back.
Destiny P.,Las Vegas  NV,83,12,2,9/28/2017,1.0,My boyfriend and I were staying in Burbank on vacation at a nearby hotel close to the BJs Burbank location and decided to get takeout from there one night since we had a coupon. I ordered the prime rib dip with white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got the sliders with French fries. The girl ringing us up was very friendly and accommodating. However  when we got back to the hotel to eat I was unpleasantly surprised. My prime rib dip was bright red in some spots and then gray in others. It looked extremely unappetizing. To top it off my mashed potatoes had MOLD on them. Yes  mold. I immediately contacted the restaurant and waited on hold several minutes to speak with a manager. I explained to him the situation and even offered to bring the food back. He then argued with me and said that they cook their prime rib to medium rare and if I brought it back he could cook it longer for me if I wanted. I said I would just prefer a refund and he said in order for me to get a refund I'd have to come back and he would have to reauthorize a charge for the entire meal on my card again (which would come off who knows when) and then I would get a refund (who knows when). I declined and he said he'd have his manager email me a gift card in  also  an undefined amount of days. I am now disgusted  without dinner  and without a refund. This was a pretty sad outcome for a place we usually love to go to.
Mariel F.,Chicago  IL,17,47,14,12/29/2016,3.0,We got there on a late Friday night and since it was the closest open restaurant from the hotel we decided to give it a try.The menu is extensive  there are different options so I would say there is something for everyone.The food was nothing extraordinary  personally the food did not have any seasoning or anything special to justify the prices.Service was ok  a little bit slow but it was a Friday night.Not sure I would return  but if I do it would definitely be any other day but Friday night.
Judy L.,Burbank  CA,90,236,645,1/22/2017,4.0,Came here just for their famous Pizookies and now with this mini trio  you can satisfy all your sweet tooth needs! Delicious as always. Check out my photo and salivate !
Rainbow Y.,Santa Ana  CA,58,10,529,9/30/2017,1.0,Do not ever go to this BJ. I just spoke to the manager Mark about an ad that we saw on TV but did not receive. My mom saw the ad on TV that lead her to want to try BJ but did not remember the name of the deal and we asked about the special that's happening now and was lead to the specials that were only happening during the weekdays not the one that was advertised on TV. So when we saw the ad again and called to find out how come we didn't get the deal that was advertised on TV  the manager Mark said that it's because they are not allowed to advertise an ad that is on TV in person because they have so many coupons going on and we had to say the specific deal to get it. I just thought if you advertise something on national TV  they should say tell you when ask about it. This just leaves a bad impression and we won't go there again.
Artin Z.,Burbank  CA,9,7,1,11/20/2017,4.0,It's a nice restaurant excellent food great service . I like their buffalo chicken pizza . I also like their sandwiches!!
Edy O.,TUJUNGA  CA,138,67,345,5/3/2017,5.0,This place is awesome  but let me start off by saying that you shouldn't expect a 5 star steakhouse. This is just a great place to hang out and have something to drink and eat  that tastes good  and has very nice staff. That's why this place got 5 stars from me. Enjoy  I suggest the ribeye  medium with an ipa.
Shirley T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,17,16,6/9/2017,1.0,"So am writing this review as we leave the restaurant. There are a couple of things that went wrong with today and most of it has to do with the long wait and service. I would normally not mind such things but it is different when I see the staff chatting and having personal conversation among each other and several empty tables. First we put or name in for a table with the girl at the front and was told 15 minutes  no problem. Then as we are sitting there with no one else waiting  it seems the girl at the host table leaves and the gentleman takes her place but not before chatting it up for about 15 minutes. We continue to wait another 10 minutes or so and the gentleman asks us if we are waiting for take out. I tell him no and that we are waiting for a table. He then says ""omg why did no one tell me  let me get you a table"". Apparently the girl didn\'t notify him of our wait. Once we get a table we sit there and look at the menu without getting acknowledgement. Normally I wouldn\'t mind especially if it is busy but we had quite a few tables around us that were empty. We figure out what we all want to order and are still waiting. By this time a little less than 10 minutes have passed. Our waiter then comes over and tells us he will be right with us. Then a few minutes pass and another group gets seated next to us. The waiter goes to them and gets their drink orders while we are still waiting with no drinks or having put any orders in. We then see the waiter go in and out of the kitchen several times and stop to have personal conversation with coworkers. By this time it has been a little under 15 minutes of just sitting at the table totaling about 40 minutes. By this time we were done and angry so we walked out."
J.Krys M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,18,8,5/15/2017,1.0,Myself and a few friends happened to be driving by the area and decided to stop by this location this saturday 4/13/17 around 5pm.... very disappointed in the end. First of all  parking is very difficult to find unless u are doing valet. Second  the bartenders werent very attentive and didnt care much for what you were saying. Third  my friend and i both ordered the Chicken alfredo... it came out (30 min later) looking like only pasta with raw broccoli on top. Neither of us were given alfredo sauce.. and the food looked as if it had been sitting for quite some time before being brought out to us:/ We were so hungry we decided to only ask for more sauce instead of returning the entire plate.10 long min later after asking our server to bring a side of sauce  we get only ONE side instead of 2. It was terrible and the broccoli was crunchy and entire plate was cold after everything. Definitely my least favorite BJ's location. I will never return here sadly.
Tadeh B.,Grandview  Glendale  CA,13,15,,10/16/2017,4.0,Great serving and fun atmosphere. I love their pan pizzas so I'm going with great food also. Drinks are really tasty too.
Ritchie P.,Granada Hills  CA,512,26,64,6/12/2017,4.0,Was here for my Sister in laws Birthday  we started off with a awesome server Brandon that is very attentive to our orders  specially with our crazy noisy group. Our appetizer orders came fast and they are delicious  the Pizza with thin crust just lasted a few seconds with our group and gone  i ordered rib eye steak for my main course  my clam chowder soup came first and the taste and texture is already perfect. My Rib eye the was another story it was salty. Over all my experience with BJ was good
Bernadette T.,Central LA  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,1,10/1/2017,1.0,We went in on 9/30 around 11pm  Waitress was horrible we waited for our drinks for more then 25 minutes.She bring our drinks It was warm we sent it all back then she still forget to bring a sprite for my daughter. Then we waited at least another half hour for food  We get serve one of of entree they didn't have why in a heck you waited all that time to tell us you don't have it.We're already pissed off!!Sliders was cold and I will never go back there again.As we were leaving there were a group celebrating there Bday there they also had a horrible experience that it took 45 min for there drinks.DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!
Kimberly R.,SYLMAR  CA,96,155,19,9/9/2017,4.0,Great server and fun atmosphere. I love their buffalo chicken pizza so I'm going with great food also. Drinks are really tasty too.
Annie T.,Los Angeles  CA,50,58,90,5/18/2017,5.0,Getting drunk at bjs lol drinking all day all the way to Palm Springs haha the food is amazing I got a healthy choice of grilled salmon with some salad I LOVE THIS PLACE I HATE THE GIRLIE DRINKS lol I just couldn't drink hard liquor with the fam bam but I need a scotch right now cheers ya filthy animals
Susan F.,Rosamond  CA,4,1,,10/22/2017,1.0,This place is horrible. We went 10/21/17 to BJ's in Burbank  we have always loved their food  not this time. I realize they were very busy that night  but that is no excuse for bad service and bad food. My daughter had the steak and it was so raw it should have been sent back. We had waited an hour for our food and she didn't want to wait any more. I had the prime rib sandwich with au jus sauce. My sandwich came without the au jus  I asked three times for the sauce and when it came it was cold and I was done. If I could give negative stars I would. This was my daughters birthday dinner. What a disappointment.
Mel B.,Ontario  CA,5,2,,8/19/2017,1.0,Used the yelp ordering feature to order curbside pickup. Pulled up and call the restaurant to let them know we were outside. They could not locate the order and I was placed on hold. The call abruptly ended so I went inside. The host did not know what we ordered so they wanted to see a copy of the order so I provided it. After waiting for 15 minutes my order was ready. They need to work on customer service and not put the blame on the customer that an order was misplaced.
Steffi H.,Newport News  VA,0,13,2,3/11/2017,1.0,Horrible service  after waiting 25 minutes for a personal pan pizza it came out freezing cold  my daughters chicken Alfredo was cold with barely any alfredo. The restaurant itself was dirty and the bathrooms I couldn't even go in because of the toilet paper streamed from one side to the other and the smell. It didn't appear that it had been cleaned in days. Very poor service  rude customer service and couldn't even get the correct bill.WILL NEVER RETURN !!!! Suggest a training day and cleaning spree for your staff
Mitch M.,Burbank  CA,2,30,3,2/6/2017,3.0,Food was great. Service wasn't. We waited almost 10 minutes after we were seated for our server  Brandon  to ask us our drink order. Then waited another almost 10 minutes to get them. I ordered a burger with no mayo or onions and a side. Burger came with mayo and onions with no side  of course waiting another 10 minutes to tell the server it was wrong. Drinks weren't refilled often. Plus side was he apologized and thanked us for our patience which is why it gets 3 and not 2 stars.I also chose BJ's because it is a bar and assumed it would not be such a playground for children. WRONG! Kids everywhere....
Narek A.,Burbank  CA,0,20,,10/19/2017,3.0,The chicken is usually not cooked well. 2 out of 3 times when I go there. I like the one in Glendale which is only 10 minutes away.
K W.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,0,17,1,9/10/2017,3.0,The waitress was amazing! However  the food was okay :-) although the cobb salad was good and my husband once again enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs our onion rings had to be sent back twice because they were cold.But like I said the waitress did her job and made sure that we didn't pay for the onion rings. And we will go back and give them another chance.
Victor C.,Henderson  NV,337,9,,8/26/2017,2.0,The wait for a take out order is ridiculous!!! Placed the order and paid for it online and had to wait an extra half hr AFTER the time it was supposed to be ready. The customer service was bad by everyone on the front end. Very disappointed.
Gio Z.,Sun Valley  CA,3,9,4,2/9/2017,1.0,I'm really not a stickler for complaining  but tonight BJ's in Burbank really brought it out of me. Me and my pregnant wife show up ready to eat. The building was practically empty at 10:30 on a Wednesday night. The waitress was nice  she took our order. But our food never came. Usually I don't mind waiting. But my impatient pregnant wife kept pointing out that it's taking longer than it should. 45 minutes pass and I started getting upset  and our food still hasn't come out. My wife confronted the waitress to let her know that we haven't gotten our food. We paid for our drinks as the manger took the time to speak to us. I can't remember what his name was but he was nice enough to get us a gift card and apologize. I'm not even sure if I'll come back here though.
Amanda W.,Los Angeles  CA,1098,235,1096,4/6/2017,4.0,Pretty good service and decent food. Nothing special/foodie about it  but good. I got the all he tuna salad and it was edible. The pizookie was to die for though. Like it's a pretty basic place  with eh food  but if you're hungry enough and you want some dang good cookie  this one's for you. I'm very healthy so I had to order a salad basically  but I'm sure the chicken tenders (which my boyfriend ordered!)  nachos  burgers  and more are delicious. Bon appetite.
Toni D.,Studio City  CA,10,15,3,1/1/2017,3.0,Where do I start?I'm going to be generous and give this place a 3 because of it being New Year's Day  when in reality a 2 would suffice. The service:From the very beginning at the hostess stand was below mediocre. There was a 20-25 minute wait that turned into a 35 min wait. That's not the problem. There were at least 12 tables open yet 20 people waiting to be seated. None of the 4 people at the hostess stand had a welcoming attitude. Then I noticed people after me were being set first. Annoying. The waitress:For whatever reason the waitress had a new hire shadowing her (the standards must be really low). She was sweet but not great at what she does. But then again maybe she was just busy.... but still you're a waitress. Another waitress had to bring me silverware and she acted as if I'd ruined her day. Outside of taking my order  she checked on me once which I then asked for my check. It took 10 minutes to get it. Then I have her my card right away... another 10 mins. It was really difficult to only tip her 20% of the check (because it was a $25 check). I normally would leave at least 50% if not a 100% tip for such a small check (especially since it's the holidays). The guy shadowing though  seems like he will be great at serving. He came by a few times on his own accord while walking by following the other waitress. The food:While didn't expect a Michelin experience the food was very basic and tasted like something from a cafeteria. My 9 year old said that this place deserved only 2 stars because of the long wait and basic tasting food. Anyway... I'm sure there's an excuse for the experience I had  but unfortunately I won't ever be back to find out.
Jaime V.,Burbank  CA,6,11,5,7/8/2017,1.0,First off we waited 25 minutes in the front waiting area with no A/C  it was super hot. Then we waited for 15 minutes before anyone came to ask if we wanted anything to drink and take our order. We were told that we were sat at a table without a waiter so the bar tender came over to take our order. The table that was sat behind us arrived about 10 minutes after we did a they were eating way before we were. When we got our food they forgot the kids fries  I ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was not. It was super dry. I ate it because I was hungry but it was a bit salty. My wife ordered the spicy peanut chicken with sobe noodles. I do not recommend it  it's a bad rendition of chicken chow mein. We also had to get up and get our own condiments from other vacant tables. To top it off there was an annoying fly going around. The bar tender was nice  but was trying to cover the bar and attend us. Don't think I will come back here!
Raul A.,Los Angeles  CA,4,14,14,2/27/2017,5.0,I've been here about three times all three times have been great different servers every time and great service from all three sometimes they are really busy and you might wait a little longer for a refill but they will come as soon as they can especially when they have big groups to take care of so it's understandable
April A.,Granada Hills  CA,0,2,,7/6/2017,3.0,In my opinion food wasn't that great  only their dessert was good. I recommend only going for their dessert.
Renee B.,San Diego  CA,1,5,,8/19/2017,1.0,Do not use curbside takeout. This feature is completely useless. You will probably have better luck calling in your order  or better yet  come in to order your Togo food.
Steve W.,Upland  CA,1,53,21,4/16/2017,3.0,"3 cons: the bathrooms were horrid. Walls dirty and bins overfilled when we arrived the gentleman who greeted us was rude and unfriendly. Then on the way out I bought 2 6packs to go for $21. I gave $25 and the reply was  ""do you need change?.. If so I have to go get it from the bar""...YES  MOVE YOUR BUTT 25FT PLEASE.Pros: food was delicious. We ordered different plays for all 10 of us and they were great. Aaron gave us great service and checked on us many times. The place is trendy and comfortable. Bill was about   $20 per person out the door."
Latisha P.,Los Angeles  CA,405,656,1226,12/1/2015,2.0,Now the Pizookie disappoints me and that's really the only reason I'd come here. FOOD Brussel sprouts (3 stars): Pretty good appetizer. The sauce goes well with it. Chicken burger-lettuce wrapped (2 stars): can you give me a smaller piece of chicken breast??? Seriously like 4 slices on there...ridiculous. Mahi mahi with shrimp (3 stars): Fish was overcooked  tough on the outside. Shrimp were cooked well though. Flavors were good.DESSERTPizookie (2 stars): Used to be so good! Now they put the thinnest cookie layer and most of it ends up getting burnt to the pan so you have to try and scrape it off! So disappointed! Before I had to ask for extra ice cream since they had more cookie  now I need way more cookie SERVICE (3 stars)Came on a Saturday night and they took our party of 7 in about 10 minutes. Our waiter was really nice but it took FOREVER for the food to come out! ATMOSPHERELots of room and tables  good place to go if you're going to watch a game. PARKINGSelf parking if you go up the steep hill to park on the top of the parking garage. Otherwise they have valet.
David B.,Los Angeles  CA,25,16,17,4/11/2017,4.0,The salmon was decent. The jambalaya my wife had was better than expected. My three girls had had spaghetti  my littlest loves spaghetti no matter it taste like. My middle child had chicken tenders and fries  they were very meaty. My eldest had chicken Alfredo  again the meat was juicy and tender  but I can't say much about the pasta and Alfredo sauce. The restrooms were a mess  both men and woman's  we had to ask the manager to stock the tissue cause they were out on this particular night.
Robert S.,Van Nuys  CA,26,11,1,7/17/2017,2.0,Waited a long time for our food. The drinks were bland. They had no taste at all and I rather go to seven eleven for drinks. I just didn't dig it  but the server did burn his hand though. Second degree burns he a tru soldier
J J.,Toluca Lake  Los Angeles  CA,3,198,163,12/26/2016,2.0,So if you are going to come here prepare to wait over an hour for your food on a busy day. Service was good but the again the wait is horrendous especially if you have hungry kids. I would think a big chain restaurant would remedy problems like this with there kitchen backed up. Well I guess this is why I haven't been here in over 5 years and won't be coming back anytime soon.
Bertboogie J.,North Hollywood  CA,112,17,2,7/14/2017,2.0,Food was ok. They could have at least paid attention to the quality of the food the served. Service was not that great. Dropped off the food  dropped off more napkins and never heard from the server again until it was time to pay.
Doc S.,Burbank  CA,2,42,5,6/27/2017,1.0,"Trying to get seated and or served is much like waiting for it to rain in Hades!! The service is absolutely horrible  combined with lousy attitudes. Time to give notice to the current ""management"" team and bring on some folks that actually understand customer service!! Food has also suffered mightily over the past few years. Maybe the cooks should join the management team exodus!!!"
Rita A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,5,12/26/2016,1.0,WORST SERVICE first off ! She was kind but the orders were messed up   forgot two of my items I specifically wanted   we waited for the food for over and hour! The utensils were DIRTY . Bria was the server   she was disrespectful after we told her something  she ignored us practically the whole night ..I saw her talking about us to all the other waiters which is very unprofessional. We finally had the manager come to our table she was sweet and convinced us it wouldn't happen again  she gave some sort of discount but I didn't care I was still disappointed
Mish S.,Long Beach  CA,365,487,651,1/26/2017,2.0,The service today was so incredibly poor. Our waitress was so unprofessional. Firstly  she was not informative about the happy hour menu and seemed annoyed when we asked her about it. Secondly  she took our friends orders but did not take ours when we were all clearly sitting at one table until we called her back after she disappeared so it was awkward waiting an extra 15 mins for our food after our friend's already came out. They had to wait and by the time our food came there was freezing cold. She was abrasive and blunt and did not make us feel welcome at all. Not only was the annoying error of not checking if the entire group had ordered a pain  but she did not push for our orders to come out first when the restaurant was empty and we ordered before everyone else  yet everyone's food came out before ours: also did I mention that we ordered tiny appetizers? It should not have take the length of around 30 mins that it did for our food. The bill even with happy hour came out to be a hefty $65  with everyone ordering one appetizer each and a drink (not all alcoholic). I love BJ's but their happy hour deals are not worth it  and this waitress definitely needs retraining. She ruined our dining experience and upset our friends with her uncaring behavior. I love BJ's dependable and variety filled menu and their quality of food  but with these type of inconsistent servers it's hard to return.
Darylynn D.,Los Angeles  CA,128,1677,7490,10/28/2015,4.0,BJs is known for their beers  pizza and pizooke. I usually get the Great White Pizza because of all the toppings. Sometimes I'll try the Sweet Pig or Barbeque Chicken Pizza when I'm feeling dangerous. The White Chocolate Macademia Nut Pizooke is full of good fatness. I know they have Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter S'mores  but I can't venture away from the Macadamia . I know when I come here there is always something new to try and I know I'm never disappointed. The place can get busy on Friday's and Saturday's so be prepared to wait. They offer valet or self-parking on top of the structure.
Luis G.,Burbank  CA,8,10,3,6/14/2017,5.0,I always happen to find my way to BJ's during the NBA finals and I'm never disappointed. The happy hour specials are pretty good and the service is attentive. My only complaint is the parking but there's nothing we can do about that.
Henrik k.,Glendale  CA,42,18,34,10/29/2016,1.0,In Burbank  Ca. Waited 45 minutes for our food. This sucked! Two inpatient hungry kids. I asked for the check for the beer and salad we ordered. I wasn't gonna wait anymore. Manager took care of the bill except for the beer. Supposedly we were 2nd up for the food.
Ivy S.,Los Angeles  CA,896,146,,10/16/2016,5.0,I love this place!!!!!This past weekend was my first time here and it's one of my new favorite restaurants.The pizza was great and the Oreo pizookie was like tasting a spoonful of heaven.Our server was Stephen F (according to the credit card slip) and he was fantastic!!!! Usually the service at chain restaurants is really bad but he was on top of everything from start to finish! It was seriously a breath of fresh air!!!!!Did I mention I LOVE IT HERE!!!!
Jen R.,Corona  CA,0,29,87,2/22/2017,3.0,This place is packed that we have to wait for a big party. We seated outside and it's better to stay away from the hustle and bustle inside the restaurant and that was nice. Food was good but not too crazy for it. Parking is a mess though.
Morpheus V.,Burbank  CA,0,1,,4/29/2017,1.0,"My 14yr old daughter warned us  only I thought she was just upset that we weren\'t going to her choice of restaurant.This place was the nightmare you always hear about  but have yet to experience. Where do I start? After a 30 minute wait  we were seated in the upper corner of the place. The waiter was a nice guy  attentive to entering our order. I assume he entered the selections correctly on his tablet device  but it started with my daughter getting a strawberry lemonade when she asked for a regular lemonade. She\'s particularly self conscious about attention and makes it clear  even though it\'s wrong  ""it\'s fine."" Our order staggered to the table  yet one thing after another was wrong. My burger was cold and lacked the normal amount of mayonnaise and also the tomatoes I requested on it. Mayo lettuce tomato and cheese is simple  yet their kitchen showed that they could screw it up on another level. Then came the pizza we ordered  oh wait  the delivery person  not our waiter  gave us someone else\'s pizza. Our waiter came over and took it back. About 10 minutes later  the waiter was heading our way with what appeared to be our actual pizza. Somewhere on the stairs up  the pizza dropped to the floor just 15 feet away from our table. He apologize and said they would get working on a new one. By the time we were eating it  most of the place had left for the night. In the end  the $13 burgers sucked. The baked Ziti was bland and left much to be desired. The right pizza took FOREVER. AND it seems that the management was like a absent landlord. After the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant  there was zero contact about how they would make it right. How can management be this oblivious to such horrible service?Instead we received our bill which exceeded $90  zero courtesy credit for the messed up order or the complete inconvenience of the pizza issue  or the horrible burgers.Go here at your own peril. But don\'t say I didn\'t warn you. We on the other hand  will avoid it and share our experience with friends and family  most who  like us  live here in Burbank  California. If you like to have customers  you should appreciate them enough to own your horrific service  and make things right with them. Otherwise  like us  they will walk away  and start running as soon as they hit the doors to the outside."
A M.,Montebello  CA,0,3,2,7/19/2017,1.0,Worst BJ's ever. The service was awful. I ordered a medium rare steak and it came 30 minutes late and so over cooked and dry. We didn't leave a tip because of the rude service and awful food. Gonna skip on BJ's from now on.
John F.,Alhambra  CA,58,106,154,10/6/2016,3.0,I just simply love the atmosphere in his particular location. I've been here years back and finally decided to come back again.SERVICE:8/10Patrick our server was absolutely friendly and welcoming   not to mention he was attentive and understood when I said I had a Yelp coupon for 10$ off of 35$.FOOD: 7/10The food is just standard American food which was decent but nothing to be amazed about. I ordered the hickory brisket burger 3/5 the patty was a bit dry and my bacon was burnt. My girlfriend ordered the meatball and spaghetti 3.5/5 pretty standard stuff they did not make a mistake on it. We also ordered the best beginnings combo which was very delicious 4/5.OVERALL: 7/10Service and food landed a solid 3 stars would recommend anyone to come by to grab yourself a drink and watch sports. $10 off 35$ is a pretty sweet deal.
Kermit T.,Burbank  CA,0,26,1,7/16/2017,1.0,It shouldnt take 2 hours for a meal. Not the first time either here. Always takes forever and something always comes out wrong. I used to work for them in Seal Beach in the 90s and they were great... What happened?
Heather F.,Bakersfield  CA,179,193,425,4/13/2016,5.0,After a day of rosebowl shopping and then ikea shopping it's dinner time . Kids ordered chicken tenders and fresh fruit. I ordered chicken wrap which I have to say was YUMMY. Then to top it off had to have the hot and delicious cookie. Service was great . There really is g anything bad I could say about his place  just that it was quick to seat even being by freeway entrance . We will come back here since we shop a lot at IKEA  Sorry a short review but it was yummy yummy
Diego H.,Los Angeles  CA,4,12,54,10/2/2016,5.0,The steak here rocks  the tomato bisque is breathtaking.Also the calamari is great to. But the root beer tastes amazing  it's practically enough to make a grown man cry.
Harmony L.,Thousand Oaks  CA,337,297,153,4/1/2016,5.0,My friend and I ordered the Mozzarela Sticks  Lemon Thyme Chicken  Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken  and of course  their pizookie trio (Monkey Bread  White Choco Macademia Nut  and Salted Caramel all with Vanilla Ice Cream). The sticks were perfect  so stringy :) The Lemon Thyme Chicken might be my favorite dish. It's healthy  great portion size  and great flavors. The pizookies were obviously amazing; a major reason I come here...just super sweet  especially the monkey bread. Gotta eat it fast before the ice cream melts!
A L.,Torrance  CA,0,4,,10/23/2016,1.0,For the past 5 years I've enjoyed the atmosphere  food & service from this restaurant chain. I've been to many locations and the customer service was great. I've been among the many that have waited over 30min to be seated; because we knew everything else from that point would be great. Until I went to this location on a Saturday night.I was seated outside quickly which was great. My server asked me for my order  which we started of with water & drinks. And then.....we waited. We waited over 20min to get our water. It wasn't until I went to look for my server  and another server visited us that we finally got some water  and then 2min later  our drinks. While I know weekends are busy it shouldnt take 20mins to at least get water. We were told the manager would be over...but whoever that was never showed. So i took 3 sips of my water  5 sips of my drink  paid the check and left. Our original server apologized for the bars delay and didn't show any accountability. No manager visited either. Disappointed customer who will NOT return to this location. I went to another restaurant later and completed my dinner; which provided great customer service and got a nice tip.
Rob C.,Lake View Terrace  Los Angeles  CA,0,40,4,6/25/2017,1.0,We go in ask for a cool spot sit. The AC IS BARELY working! Snooty waiter ignores us   then after a bit tells us the table is not part of the bar so we have to check in. I do hostess says no problem  five minutes later we told we must move! No I guess the money we were spending was not important to them! Manners gang manners!
Sharee I.,Long Beach  CA,37,44,14,7/1/2017,5.0,We stopped in on the Friday night around 9:30 p.m. . We were seated pretty quickly. We are the drinks in our food or waiter got it to us pretty quickly within 10 minutes we had our order and our dinner on the table. food was delicious Vibe was great.
Daniel R.,Los Angeles  CA,2,6,,8/6/2017,1.0,I swear i am never going to BJ's ever again not only did i found egg shells in my pasta but the service was terrible. I use to go with a couple of friends every once in a while and when i did go we would usually get ignored by our own server because he is way too focused on the bigger party next to us. Mind you i always tip 15 percent and i always try to be polite because i use to worked in the food industry but the people working at BJ's lack proper training. Not only do they ignore you but the one time i go with my family to celebrate a few day after my sister graduation they made us wait a hour for our food because the system went down and instead of apologizing the server had the guts to tell my cousin waiting a 1 hour and 30 min for a party of eight is the norm and gave a lot of attitude when we ask when is our food was coming. Not only did the food came late but it was also cold. To stop us from leaving the manager promised us to give us a pizookie on our next visit instead of there and now and when we asked if we can get a coupon or a written agreement he told us he told us he would honor his word and when we did come back he lied to our faces and said he does not remember that and played ignorant till we left. All in all the service is terrible unless your in a big party  the manager is a liar  and the food is not even that great it comes out lacking flavor  cold  and might have egg shells in it. BJ is expensive for no good reason when the service is terrible and the food is not even that great. Congrats to BJ's for not only losing a customer but everyone i am associated with.
Fred M.,Los Angeles  CA,13,5,,2/23/2017,3.0,Food taste good. But the service is bad. We ware a group of 13. Half of us got our food 1hr faster than the rest. We got the appetizer after our food
Robert R.,Glendale  CA,1,6,,5/14/2017,1.0,Soooo  I gave BJ's one last try. I already gave up on the Glendale location as their service was well below standards. I had already visited the Burbank location and thought it was struggling with the customer service too  but decided I'd meet up with a buddy to have a couple of beers and an appetizer. Wouldn't you know it. It took 45 minutes to get Chicken lettuce wraps. That's only after reminding the bartender that we placed an order over a half an hour ago. And chicken lettuce wraps are an appetizer!! Scoop some chicken  slap it on the plate with some lettuce and serve it! Heavens forbid if we dare order an entree. We'd be there at closing time eating. One bartender to cover that entire bar plus table drinks. This is a joke. I'm done. Never again!
Hayk I.,Glendale  CA,220,2,,7/14/2017,1.0,Decent deep dish pizza  but somebody PLEASE teach these so called bartenders how to pour a pint of Guinness. I've been back many times with coworkers because of location  but last night's stale beer was the last straw for me. Won't be returning.
Jen N.,Henderson  NV,121,460,868,6/23/2015,5.0,This weekend was our first time at a BJ's Brewhouse. Definitely will not be the last. Their food was excellent. My husband and I got the California Chicken Club  with bacon  avocado  swiss  lettuce  tomato  roasted garlic mayo and grilled sourdough. The sourdough tasted like garlic bread  and there was a lot of avocado. Very flavorful.My in-laws both go the Lemon Thyme chicken  with herb roasted chicken breast  seasoned brown rice  sauted red bell peppers  tomatoes   roasted brussel sprouts in a lemon thyme sauce. They could not get over how flavorful this was  and actually ordered this twice in two days. *Lunch version comes with one piece of chicken  whereas the entre is $2 more and comes with two pieces.On our second day  my husband and I got the Tavern Cut Pizza 'Cantina Chicken' with Alfredo sauce  grilled chicken breast  green chilies  cilantro  their signature 5 cheese blend as well as Jack cheese and Cheddar. This was much bigger than I thought that it would be. The flavors were excellent. I was worried about the green chilies  but they gave a nice tang to the pizza. I would order this again in an instant. Shannon was our waitress on the second day  and she was hilarious. Very personable  and funny.
Ian A.,Los Angeles  CA,9,18,3,9/11/2016,2.0,Whatever you do  don't sit at the bar. Each time that my wife and I come here  the service is horrible. The two women on the weekend are the worst. First  they take for ever to ask if you like a drink or something to order off the menu. One of the reasons it seems is that the bartenders are cleaning massive amounts of cups  pouring drinks for the entire restaurant and they are balancing the register. I think if management were to actually think about how much the bartenders are doing  they would staff accordingly. Right now as I type this  my wife and I waited for our desert for 15 minutes and the bartender never checked on us. We had to flag her down. In fact  she walks by each person and never asks if they need anything.This isn't the first time and this place must be Union. The bartenders must be dishwashers and janitors  bc all they do is clean and never ask if anyone needs anything. Please staff one extra person or go over what service should mean. The BJ's in HB and Tustin are much better.
Anton N.,Redondo Beach  CA,4,11,,10/18/2016,2.0,Oh BJ's. For some reason you are very consistent at pretty bad service. I went with a couple and warned one of them to prepare for bad service. We called ahead  then arrived and were asked to wait 15 to 20 minutes. So much for calling ahead. When it hit about 20 minutes I told the hostess we called ahead and had been waiting for a while. Nothing other than they completely screwed up; and if I did not ask we probably would never had been seated. Food is always pretty good on another side  but to add to this they screwed up my simple order as well :-).
Niat A.,Oakland  CA,0,5,,4/19/2017,3.0,I ordered the brew house burger which was yummy. My mother on the other hand ordered the Peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp and that was super dry and flavorless. Overall average chain restaurant
Christine S.,Glendora  CA,0,4,,9/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Bjs is usually my first choice when dining out... but this bjs I will never return to again! Horrible service  food taste so different I left feeling sick.I had my usual fettuccini Alfredo with a coke. The waiter served us our dinner with no utensils what do we eat with? We asked nicely  waited patiently 15 min passed and we asked again. Of course  we had a cold dinner. No problem we still ate it and left! After couple days I posted this review manager contacted me by email to apologize   I found that very professional of him to do that. Thank you Nick For taking the time and effort to apologize!
Melanie W.,Studio City  CA,373,24,100,8/18/2016,1.0,We came here last weekend and once again regretted it. I'm not one to complain but sometimes you can become so annoyed and disappointed with a place that you really should say something. When we walked in it was pretty empty and quiet with tons of tables open in the front and back. There are two separate desk areas in the entrance. One was empty and the other had three people behind it talking. You could tell that they weren't servers because of their attire. We stood there as they continued to talk and ignore us and waited until I tried to get their attention. Someone suggested that we could sit at the bar table tops for happy hour if we would like and we declined because we wanted to sit more comfortably than teetering on some tall stools with tables. More confused conversations ensued and they asked if we would like to sit in the back of the restaurant and we requested to sit in one of the booth areas near the front. They told us that we would have to wait until the hostess returned to seat us and 'make sure that it was 'okay' so we sat down and waited. We were the only two people waiting to be seated. Five minutes later (finally) this extremely busy hostess in this empty restaurant showed up and asked us if we wanted to sit in 'happy hour' and again we said no thank you can we please sit in the front and she said that's happy hour and I asked about the booths and many tables beside the happy hour and that's when she said I'll have to ask someone first and then she asked 'Would you like to sit in the back?' REALLY? Seriously? Umm  no. 1st thing-We already had this conversation with someone else 2nd -that's where you should put large parties and families or for when they have a fully packed restaurant. Why would you put a couple of two in the back of a very big empty restaurant? Especially if they already asked to be seated in a different section already. It's insulting. Listen  I know the drill. You have servers in certain areas and it's your job to farm tables for sections and their servers. I get it  but don't put guilt trips on customers because they don't want to sit there and try to make them feel like they are being difficult. Unacceptable. Smile and say of course.Next we get our waitress who was a bit intense. She seemed irritated or something. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer (they never came out) our server didn't even notice until after our salads and we were eating our meal. (Another thing that I would like to mention here is that the wait staff doesn't even bring the food to your table and I know that's common now and I get it-but the waiter or waitress should always come over and make sure everything is thumbs up) Plus how can you be soooooo busy when you don't even have to bring out the food??? Seriously? I just don't understand. I was a waitress in one of the busiest restaurants in town. She was nowhere to be found 95% of the time. When she finally realized it she said 'you still want those wings right?' and I said 'no  it's okay' and she got irritated and huffed off. This brings me to the food. Every meal that I've had has always been sub-par. Everything tastes very bland and mass produced. There's not a lot of love in what they serve  or a very good palate. The selection (book) menu doesn't feel right. It's way too large and Overwhelming-while the food is Underwhelming. The golden rule is don't try to do everything just do some things really well. Anyway  it was my man's birthday and still trying to make the best of the situation we ordered the cookie with ice cream. I think they call it a Pizookie?? it came out hard as a rock. You couldn't even put a fork in it. It was terrible. The whole experience was terrible. Like a bad dream. The hostess was difficult. The waitress was difficult and the food doesn't cut it. Their only saving grace is their beer selection. I'm not going to name our server because I don't want to point her out specifically-but her attitude stinks. Maybe one of the managers will note that she was working the front bar and seating area last Friday. Maybe she was in a bad mood that day but who cares? not us when we're trying to have a nice dinner. I've worked in two different restaurants and the first rule is to leave your emotions at the door. especially if you want to make money. Her attitude is affecting your business because we won't be coming back. Any suggestion that I would have is to change your staff or do some retraining and remind them that they are in customer service. They seem to be more preoccupied in conversations with co workers and giving attitude more than making a pleasurable dining experience. Also try to make a better smaller menu. We go to dinner three times a week and we've given this place more than a few tries and this was our last. We aren't returning but I'm hoping that someone within the company will read this and make some severely necessary changes to this restaurant. Good luck!
Jeannie M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,4/20/2017,1.0,I came here with my nephew on a Thursday around 9:30. There was a 15 minute wait which is about what we expected. They weren't that busy  so I wasn't expecting the horrible service we got.  Our appetizer came but we didn't have plates so I asked the gentleman if he could bring us some. He passed us up two times before I finally asked him again. He apologized and said he'd be right back. We never saw him at our table again. About 5 min later the food came. We ended up just starting everything at the same time.  My nephew ordered a burger  and when the waitress finally came back ( We hadn't seen her since she took our order) he asked for ketchup. By the time it showed up he had finished his fries  and his burger was cold.  She walked away before he could ask for a refill so he sat through his meal without one. Noticing this I made sure to go easy on my iced tea. After we were done we sat there for about 10 min longer before the guy who forgot our plates noticed us and walked to the back. Coincidentally our waitress emerged and asked if we needed refills. I told her we needed a refill and some boxes because we just wanted to leave.  She came back another 10 minutes later to take our plates and ask if we needed anything else and 5 min later she dropped the check. My nephew burst into laughter when she came back for the check because that was done in under 2 minutes.  I get it. I was a waiter for over 10 yrs  and sometimes you get busy. This was not that situation. Nobody in that place gave a crap  and management was nowhere to be found.  I left a tip because they have to pay taxes  but I'll be damned if I go back to that place.
Gigi G.,Alhambra  CA,0,2,1,1/25/2017,3.0,My friend and I decided to go to this place yesterday for lunch  our experience was not what we expected from a place so popular like BJ'S. First off  I ordered fried Calamari  let me tell y'all it was hard as a rock  dried and old. Then we were offered a free dessert if we sign up for the members rewards program. Well we ended up paying for it. Overall bad experience.
Kira P.,Los Angeles  CA,181,77,171,9/30/2015,5.0,"My husband and decided to go to BJ\'S last night because it was Free Pizookie Day. When we arrived we found out there was a 20 minute wait. (Which was to be expected on this momentous day) As it was  the main bar was full so we had to wait. My husband got antsy 10 minutes into our wait and decided to explore the restaurant... and he found a second bar! (There is actually another bar inside the restaurant area) We asked the host and he said yes  we can seat ourselves at that bar as well.Once seated we were greeted by Rebecca who said  ""Thanks for deciding to join me tonight guys."" Right away we knew we had made the right choice. Her bright smile  welcoming personality  and charisma made us feel right at home.While perusing the menu I couldn\'t find the stuffed baked potatoes. Rebecca assured me that they do still have then on the menu  they are just on the lunch menu now. I was elated  since I had been craving that dish for weeks  and was looking forward to finally getting to go to BJ\'s so I could have it. Throughout our meal Rebecca was very attentive and always there whenever we needed anything. Towards the end of our meal we overheard a regular asking our server how she liked married life. So when she returned to our table we inquired if she is newly married? She told us that she just got married in May. We informed her our wedding was just 3 weeks ago. We congratulated eachother and it was a bonding moment.All in all  the food was delicious  our food came out very fast  the service was excellent  and the Pizookie was the icing on the cake (so to speak). Thank you BJ\'s for making our date night truly special! To ensure our compliments get to the right place I feel it necessary to include information that might help. 0490 Table 652 Rebecca 30 SvrCk: 12 9:10p 9/29/15"
Marissa B.,Burbank  CA,16,103,22,3/4/2017,1.0,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I contacted the restaurant Friday to schedule a reservation for 10 people Saturday. Some snotty a-hole answered the phone  put me on hold first then told me to call back in the morning. When I asked if reservations were possible he said  ""call back in the morning"" and hung up. I reluctantly called back today and was told to hold while the person who answered transferred me to a manager. I asked for an explanation  ""why did I need a manager?"" He said they were booked  I asked what their reservation policy was? He said typically you have to reserve a day prior or days prior. I explained I had attempted to reserve and was told to call the next morning. At least this person was a bit more helpful but still a ridiculous attempt to book reservation. Bottom line  this is shitty customer service and now my party of 10 will take their business elsewhere"
Regina P.,Burbank  CA,16,71,48,2/8/2016,2.0,BJ's has really declined in their service and quality of their food. On this particular visit  my dad ordered a steak to be well-done and was shocked to see how raw the meat was (I posted a photo). At first  he tried to forget about it and dunk the pieces in some A1  but the texture was chewy and tasted bloody. So  as you can imagine  it was difficult to swallow.I called to speak with a manager and I was surprised by the lack of reaction to my dad's raging red steak. He tried to be reassuring by insisting that my dad was always welcome to have his meal sent back to the kitchen to be fixed. I explained to the manager that my father was a diabetic and couldn't wait for the restaurant to get things right on their second  or perhaps  third try. I didn't appreciate the direction of our interaction. I felt as though the manager was simply shrugging off the incident as something that happens sometimes  instead of taking full accountability and apologizing on behalf of their error. Although I made it clear that there was no excuse for the raw steak  it still felt like taking it off the bill was pulling teeth for this guy  (though it should have been a no-brainer). It's unbelievable what customer service has become. I feel like this restaurant needs to be more willing to take responsibility for their mishaps and not try to smooth things over by offering a free pizookie. You can't buy a consumer's loyalty with a hot cookie and vanilla bean ice cream  even if it does sound tempting. Simply apologizing and not making excuses for your staff's error would've sufficed. Speaking up about the quality of food being sub-par shouldn't be taken lightly. My parents don't go out to eat much and they shouldn't have to settle or wait forever for the staff to get it right.
Myra L.,Sun Valley  CA,5,10,,12/28/2016,5.0,Drove in from Las Vegas and was greated with enthusiastic and friendly faces. We were seated immediately and our waitress was very informative on the specials and what was the most popular dishes. Our daughter was a bit fussy but our waitress  Amanda  was very patient and kind. The meal was delicious and the experience was worth it. We wil be back  especially for the pizookie. Thank You Amanda  you're such a gem.
Frank S.,Los Angeles  CA,82,46,6,6/11/2017,5.0,We came here during dinner service. There was a problem with their system so every orders were delayed. We waited almost an hiur just to get our food. However  the waitress and the manager was very accomodating; they told us the reason why everything was late. Because we got our food really late  they gave us a big discount; which was really awesome. The customer service was reallt phenomenal. The food was also good.
Ardi M.,Woodland Hills  Los Angeles  CA,218,4,,3/25/2017,1.0,"Went in around 11:15 pm last night. Waited almost 45 min to get a cold pizza that wasn\'t even made right. On top of that the manager tried to compensate us for our time by ""rushing out"" another pizza which took 30 min. Our server said that our manager is going to ""hook you guys up"" on the bill when all they did was deduct the first pizza which was supposed to be replaced regardless cause it didn\'t even taste like a bqq chicken pizza. I go to the Woodland Hills location at least minimum once a month and when I compare the 2 it\'s pathetic as to how disgusting the customer service was from both the server and manager. Manager was a small short middle eastern looking woman. I hope other people don\'t have to go through what I went through last night."
Cheri S.,Camarillo  CA,53,10,2,6/9/2017,1.0,Serving half the table   then serving the rest of the table a half hour later is BS. What the H?????
Elaine P.,Winnetka  Los Angeles  CA,48,146,591,9/3/2015,5.0,"I was wary of coming here due to the recent reviews  but I got the opposite experience.Went here Monday night for a farewell dinner. Parking is free and it\'s a 2-3 story lot next to the restaurant. It\'s fairly busy even on a Monday  but we were seated quickly. Our server was the nicest guy ever. Friendly demeanor  patient  and didn\'t get our orders wrong (argh! I wish I remembered his name to give him credit!). When he found out that it was a reunion  farewell  and late bday celebration all in one  he was like ""I usually don\'t do this but...""When someone says that  you can\'t help but be curious.He offered to make us a \'pizookie platter\'. What is that you ask? Well  I\'ll just say It\'s a monster. It\'s 4 cookie flavors in a large pizza pan topped with a mountain of ice cream. None of us could finish it (I regret nothing! NOTHING!).Other than our main waiter  other servers were nice and helpful when we asked them to take pictures of us. Our main food and drinks were great  no complaints there. Get the fish and chips (extra tartar) and the berry cider (Jerry Berry  I think it\'s called).All in all  a great place to bring a small group of friends. The customer service made the memories all the more sweeter (hah! I\'ll shut up now.)."
Kayla R.,Los Angeles  CA,107,104,240,4/19/2016,5.0,I've been here several times & even at the Glendale location. Not sure why I haven't written a review yet  but I really needed to after my last experience. We came here last Thursday after my brother's pinning ceremony and figured this would be a quick and smart place to go and have a celebratory dinner.We walked in with 7 of us. They just needed to set the table & had us seated right away. Our server was Jan & she took care of us entirely.Everyone got their own thing  but I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. I always always always get the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms when I'm here. It is so freakin' good. Highly recommend!!!!!!!My parents shared a rack of ribs with their side soups. My brother got the jambalaya. I'm not sure what the rest of our group ordered  but everyone was happy. No complaints. Everything was delicious. I tried some of my parents' & brother's order and everything was cooked & seasoned well.Our server even offered a complimentary pazookie to my brother as we were there celebrating him as a new college graduate. How sweet & kind of her! It was such a special day for him  so I thought it was extremely thoughtful of her to do that for us without us even asking!!!!!!!!!She took care of us from beginning to end & her section was full!!!!! I love a good server.Good food. Good service. For our most recent experience here  5 stars!
Sarkis A.,Burbank  CA,75,50,552,7/29/2017,1.0,wow i'm going to give theses people 1 star since the whole place is empty and they said we have to wait 15 to get a table. can you believe this one employee can bring down a good biz
Whippet G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,10,,6/13/2017,3.0,I really do enjoy their diverse menu and food  but never go there if you are in a hurry! I went there an hour and 15 minutes before I planned to catch a movie at the AMC. I only ordered an appetizer and a salad  and it took them AN HOUR to bring them to me. I was literally getting up to leave and cancel my order when the food finally arrived. So  the server took the app off my bill (because it was the cheaper of the two) and put my salad in a to-go box. I attended the movie hungry  and very annoyed. PS Nobody wants to eat a leftover soggy salad! I still gave them 3 Stars because when I do have unlimited time to devote to dining out  the food is great! Those servers must be perpetually slammed  because it's always the slowest service in town!
Jason R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,5,2/18/2017,1.0,wow what can i say! only rating 1 starr because i cant put 0. get to the restaurant with a party of 10  on a saturday night. get sat down rather fast about 15-20 mins. take our waiter about another 10 mins to get or drinks which i thought was weird. he takes our order it took over an hour to bring the food. aside from it taking over an hour for our food everyone around us that got there after us got their food first. the food was also cold. i ordered a guacamole bacon burger and our waiter asked how i wanted my patty and i said well done. when i got my burger it was so pink i asked him to take the burger back and not bring me anything. it is by far the worst service i have ever received from a restaurant. food was cold  waiter was attentive worst birthday my friend has ever spent. waiter didnt want to give his name when we asked for it. it said ryan on the receipt.
Briana N.,Sunland  CA,0,48,5,6/11/2017,1.0,Terrible service! We asked to order rite away as our party was hungry and knew what they wanted. We were there for TWO HOURS!!! It took forever for our food to come and anything else we asked for. Will never come to this location again.
Melanie D.,Los Angeles  CA,305,934,1517,2/25/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,This review is for BJ's beer dinner event.Several times per year  BJ's holds beer dinners  highlighting a special brewery. This time it was Rogue Brewery from Oregon. The dinner is 4 courses with 8 different beers to try - 6 from Rogue and 2 beers that they brew themselves. The cost is $30 advanced purchase  $35 on the day of the event.They started with the lightest brew (good chit pilsner - yes  that's the name!) and progressed to the richest one (double chocolate stout). They served a variety of ales in between. Each beer pour was about 6 oz  so drinking a full 8 of them would have been way too much. They were very generous with their pours (sometimes offering seconds)  and it was nice to be able to taste so many different beers.Unfortunately  the food was lackluster and boring. They started with 2 appetizers - crispy  fried artichokes and chicken tavern-cut (thin crust) pizza. The entree was cajun pasta. The apps were tasty enough but nothing special. The entree was horribly bland with a minimal amount of chicken and overcooked pasta. Dessert was an individual sized peanut butter pizookie (basically a big chewy cookie) topped with vanilla ice cream. If you like their pizookie  this is right up your alley. The amount of beers to try was impressive  but the food left a lot to be desired. I'm glad I tried it  but unless they elevate the food  it will be my last beer dinner here.parking -limited free self parking or valet
Edythe M.,Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,77,31,16,5/15/2017,5.0,Their BBQ drop dish of sooooo fire!  Never disappointed with anything from pizza  to pasta or chicken dishes. Even their entree salads are on point.
Jazmine G.,Sun Valley  CA,26,43,47,5/12/2016,5.0,I was here about one week ago we came just to have some good dinner and to our surprise it was surprisingly on point.I hadn't been here in a while so I didn't know what to expect. My fiance got a bison burger  I on the other hand was craving clam chowder but for some reason I went with the bacon brisket burger which was delicious btw I have not had such a good burger in so long.We also got calamari has an appetizer because that's always good and of course my boyfriend couldn't say no to some good beers and a triple chocolate Pizookie.Janice was really nice  great customer service.
Johanna M.,Los Angeles  CA,10,6,8,3/4/2017,1.0,Worst place to eat. Service sucks. Especially on a Saturday. All the tables get waited. But if I got here first where's my food. Maybe it doesn't help that you ask who's your waiter. No water offered upon arrival. The impression I got being from out of town is. Don't come here so bad. No appetizer even though it was ordered. Food came kinda cold. And we'll after telling the waiter no appetizer just food. I did get a free desert. But was gonna order one anyways. At least my date had a better mood then mines.
Robert L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,24,22,3/5/2017,3.0,got here and the place was jam-packed. After a 40 minute wait we were seated. 20 minutes later we got to order and another half hour before our food was delivered. To top it off all the food was cold
Erika M.,Prosper  TX,1,11,,3/9/2017,1.0,This was terrible food. I had the deep dish mini pizza. Something on the pizza tasted soured. The thin crust pizza was also not good. My husband said the gluten free pizza was actually pretty good. Overall it was way below average and not worth your hard earned dollars.
Cindy A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,14,16,4/30/2017,3.0,Service was ok at best. Waited about 15-20 to be seated. Waitress didn't come to our table too often and was nowhere to be seen. She kind but quite clumsy. She dropped a utensil when picking up our plates. Our food arrived after over 20 minutes of waiting and the pizza we ordered wasn't hot anymore. My family took a bit into it and it was cool. This place redeemed itself with my correct order of the California chicken club.
Peter V.,Fresno  CA,9,8,,5/13/2017,4.0,Great place to eat  good prices and enjoyed the atmosphere here. The outside was well furnished and I recommend to many that enjoy great food
Leona R.,Spring Valley  CA,396,120,104,3/23/2017,3.0,average BJs  nothing too special. they are almost always consistent with their food
Webes T.,Sun Valley  CA,0,48,,3/9/2017,1.0,save yourself the frustration of being treated like shit and eat anywhere else in LA but this particular BJs. The staff is so bad. Seems like every time I try to go here I just get frustrated with the staff. This time they couldn't even seat us right. I couldn't take and left. I hope the new restaurants opening in Burbank are better and don't hire anyone from this BJs!!
Monica T.,Covina  CA,0,1,4,4/26/2017,5.0,Just got back from a dinner with coworkers and our waiter Mike was A M A Z I N G. I don't usually do these Yelp reviews but I feel like Mike really did make our visit a great one. He was on top of everything and so kind! We even asked when he's usually in just to go back and have him as our waiter! Ask for him if you want great customer service!
Kevin B.,Panorama City  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,6/10/2017,1.0,By far my worse experience at BJ's in Burbank. The service was slow  they had issues with their point of order system and paying. It took 15 minutes from the time we sat down before they even asked about drinks  took our entire order. My wife's beer came relatively fast  our cheese sticks came out. We had to ask for the two remaining drinks  one water and one strawberry lemonade. Explanation  they had to get the lemonade from the back. But how long does it take to get water.We had a coupon for a free appetizer and two gift cards. We ordered two deserts which they comped because of the slow service. I reminded them of the free appetizer when I gave them the gift cards. I estimated the amount of the check  when I got it back I owed $16  but they could not get the one gift card to work because of system issues. The amount was higher than I expected  I asked for the check  was handed the wrong one  we were a table of three adults and I was handed a check with kids meals on it. I finally got the check and saw they had not take off the appetizer. We went over the check  the free appetizer and the one gift card  we estimate a credit of $4. I left an $8 additional tip. Much higher than was deserved but I once was a waiter. And we left.When I got home and put my leftover flat pizza away there were only three slices when I know there were 4 left.It may be a while before I go back.
Mel D.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,366,165,104,1/4/2016,4.0,Look it's BJs (hayoh)... We all know what the food is like  it's very typical. Nothing special but it is one of the better restaurants to go to for a game or meeting. What I love most about this specific location is the parking. You never have to worry about parking because you can always valet.Like I mentioned  food is alright. I usually get the bbq salad or wings and they've always been good. But it's nothing crazy to flip the table over from excitement. It's alright - just alright!
Joe E.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,841,381,1218,12/30/2014,2.0,It's kind of silly to write a review that is only highlighting lunch specials. A chicken quesadilla and chicken tacos. Each served with a side of black beans and 3 tortilla chips. 3. Coming in at around 6 dollars a piece  what is there to complain about? It's just that the tacos were so dry it was almost inedible. The quesadilla was mostly crispy tortilla. If you're going to have lunch specials  at least make them good. Next time we drive by all I will think about is the blah food we had last time. On the bright side  the beer was 3.50 a pint. Their IPA is pretty tasty if you're a fan of the West Coast style. Service also wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either. Parking is valet so bring some singles.
Diana G.,Los Angeles  CA,176,87,213,7/28/2016,4.0,I don't usually go to big chains  as I love to support mom and pop shops  but I have been going here for years (10+). I am a rewards member and get a lot of deals sent to my email. BOGO  free desserts and/or half priced meals. Because of this  I have tried almost everything on the menu. The one thing I recommend most is the pizza. Nothing beats that deep dish. I have tried the meats  Mediterranean and Hawaiian.I also like their sandwiches  fries (both skinny and fat)  calamari  parmesan chicken  steak  mashed potatoes  salads  etc...I can go on and on. Their ahi salad....OMG....Do yourself a favor and GET IT! Thank me later. Ok  I feel like I am all over the place on this review. I've been there too many times. The only reason I knocked off a star is because their burgers are not that great. I've given them a few chances  but they are never right. Only once did I return the burger  but it still came back as burnt as the first one  so I stopped ordering them. I've never had a problem with the service. They have usually been very friendly and attentive.
Chelsea S.,Los Angeles  CA,1,9,1,1/20/2017,1.0,I want to start off by saying I was server myself at a local Cheesecake Factory and now work at Marriott as guest services so I know how crazy guests can get. I don't ever complain because I understand the struggle. But this review can be used as a training tool. Our server started out as a welcoming male and then he went on break and was replaced by Alyssa. We ordered appetizers  sliders two with cheese and the other two without along with the beginnings combo. When the food came out the sliders had no cheese so I simply told her the situation and she looked at me with a blank face. With that  awkward silence so I suggested to just bring a slice of cheese and I'll make it myself. The cheese didn't come out for another 25 minutes so by then the sliders were cold and dry. Still  I did not complain. The service by her was very poor. She had an unprofessional attitude. After the cheese came we didn't ask her for anything else because we wanted to avoid her unprofessionalism. Paid for our meal and left.
Christel L.,Murrieta  CA,572,641,1647,2/4/2015,3.0,We were in the area and I had a BJ's gift card  so we came here for lunch. Wanting a little sun  we opted to sit on the patio rather than the dimly lit restaurant so the seating was quick. We ordered a couple of lunch specials and drinks. The food (personal pizza  salad  sandwich) was your standard BJ's quality food. Wedge salad  potato wedges  chicken tenders  and of course the small pizookie were good  but the pulled pork sandwich didn't have enough sauce on it. From this visit I've now noted that they've gotten on board with smaller drink portions  so I got a half pint of their Berry Burst Cider since it was still midday. The service was fine albeit laggy  but put me on the list of others who have issues with their valet parking. Being first time visitors  we pulled into the lot thinking the only option was valet because of their sign. If we knew self parking was also an option we would have tried that first  or at least nearby parking. Instead  we shelled out an extra $4 and change because they specifically encourage gratuity.
Sean W.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,7,11,,4/15/2017,3.0,Sunny day  130p. Burbank.Pull into BJs driveway. Valet blocking road. We know the top of the structure is wide open so we pass paying $4.50. Walk into BJs  empty. Empty like a Kmart on... any day. Sit at the bar where we are told service should be even faster  however  that was a big lie.Nice server  very chatty  but slow on delivery. The Bingo partners next to us also complained about their service. On our walk out we thanked the greeters  responded to ourselves  twice  and walked out - not hearing a peep. If you like beer  recommend.
Britta G.,Los Angeles  CA,515,240,399,1/24/2015,4.0,"I know BJ\'s is one of those chains that everyone knows about  but I\'ll write a review anyways! I personally love this specific BJ\'s because it\'s so huge. You never have to wait for a table. I\'m also a fan of the layout. There are a few different rooms so it doesn\'t feel like you are surrounded by people. I\'ve gotten so many things here  but I would say the ""Great White"" pizza is my absolute favorite. The personal size is perfect. I don\'t even like deep dish pizza but I just love it. ALL of the appetizers are phenomenal. You really can\'t go wrong. My favorite is the pepperoni pizza dip though. I\'ve made pizza dip before with basically the same ingredients and it\'s no where near as good as theirs. This really goes without saying  but the pizookies are life changing. I went this morning and was happy to find out they have a weekend brunch menu. I ordered the breakfast flatbread pizza and it was really good! Well cooked and flavorful."
Daisy I.,Downey  CA,0,8,1,9/3/2017,2.0,Ordered an deep dish ziti for take out. And it didn't have much sauce or flavor. Very disappointed about BJ's. Never going back again
Michelle D.,Vista  CA,0,12,7,5/31/2017,4.0,To be honest the food was great BUT they brought my brisket burger to the wrong table and I had to wait an additional ten minutes. I'm not picky but the customer service wasn't the best. I tried to get gravy and find a waiter for 10 minutes and he was no where to be found. The stars were earned by the quality of food and the fact that they made it right by offering a desserr
Cynthia A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,5,,2/18/2017,1.0,"ONLY RATING IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAVE TOO. Worst service ever the waiter was like ""oh I\'m going to help you guys with your drinks but let me help the other table first"" came back 35 mins later took our drinks waited more than an hour for our food asked for the burger well done and it tasted like it was only cooked for a couple mins the red juice was coming out of it completely gross. And when we got the food it wasn\'t even hot. To top it off it wasn\'t even that busy never coming here again!!!"
Rachel L.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,1,2,1,7/27/2016,1.0,Tbh man  I came in here pretty excited for some good food  but I was fucking wrong smh! I asked for a Mac N Cheese  and all I got was the noodles without any sauce  or salt! What kind of food is this man? I hope y'all don't expect me to pay for this because I'm super heated! PLUS FOUND A CRICKET ON THE WALL NEAR MY FOOD AND MY WIFEY WAS TRIPPING SHIT! GET THE FOOD INSPECTORS TO INSPECT THIS BITCH AGAIN! KAREEM OUT
Maria M.,Sylmar  CA,153,1,,2/4/2017,1.0,I am here right now ...it didn't take long to get seated but when we did we ordered our food and took almost an hour my husband asked for his burger n it came out pink so we asked if they could fix it took another 25 min the 2 tables on each side of us came ate and are waiting for the check while me and my husband are barley starting to eat......never again
susie a.,Burbank  CA,0,91,96,2/4/2017,2.0,Slowest service ever and the food isn't that great. Ovoid this place if you are hungry!!
Eva S.,San Fernando  CA,1,14,,4/5/2017,1.0,"Service and quality of food have gone downhill. Server Marcus first forgot to put our appetizer order than finally came with the coldest order of calamari. I asked for another it was inedible. A long time later our entrees came out. Shrimp and asparagus pasta was . Pretty much salty marinara sauce. Fish n chips were super oily not crispy at all. I asked for wedge cut fries server didn\'t notify me that they ran out til after my order came n gave me regular. He finally ask for the check and he takes 20 min to bring it. Server kept disappearing on us and would randomly walk by n say ""oh yea u wanted this or that"" Worse service and food!! Go to woodranch grill near by. Much better quality food and better service. Also  when the bill came it was just the printed bill no portfolio along with it to place your card in. How awkward is that felt like I was at Denny\'s lol"
Jovanee R.,San Diego  CA,73,18,28,1/4/2017,1.0,On my way to my flight for New York City my friends and I decided to check this place out. The waiter by the name of Jessie was not friendly and took forever to take our order. She never refilled our water cups and our orders were all messed up and our food was cold. I will NEVER go back to this place and will not recommend it to any of my friends. Bad customer service and bad food.
Elen S.,Los Angeles  CA,16,8,,2/3/2017,1.0,Came to celebrate my birthday with my friends. It took over an hour for the food to come and the only reason they brought it out was because we complained on the wait. The pizookie ice cream was melted  my mini pizza was cold. It was absolutely the most disappointing birthday dinner I ever had in my life to the point that we ended up leaving the place without touching the food. Absolutely unacceptable.
Jennifer K.,Los Angeles  CA,3,2,9,4/14/2017,5.0,We have been here many times. It is always good. We came tonight and had the pleasure of getting Heather as our server. She told us about the prime rib special  which two of us got. Although my meat was too rare for me (even after they cooked it more)  I didn't really care. Heather was awesome. She didn't have to write anything down and got everything right. She kept checking on us and making sure our drinks were full and we were doing ok. She was very personable and friendly. I will definitely ask for her next time.
Paola S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,,7/6/2017,1.0,Went on a Sunday at around 12:30. It was a nice day so we sat outside  don't know if that's why our service was so bad. It wasn't even as busy as I expected  but maybe they were understaffed? Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an additional 10 to get our orders taken. Had to ask for silverware and once we got it  it was dirty. There was a guy smoking at the table next to us. The waiters didn't ask him to put out his cigarette until someone complained. There was a family with a dog that came after us and the dog got fed before we did!this location sucks. Would recommend a different location.
Gunner J.,Los Angeles  CA,5,38,21,4/25/2017,4.0,Great place to eat  very many options. Sometimes the service can be a little slow... especially if it's a big game night. But the food is great  pizzookies make the whole trip to this place worth it! Highly recommend those! The spaghetti is great  the Siracusa queso is also great and I haven't really had anything I didn't like here! Enjoy!
I. T.,Glendale  CA,1,29,2,4/24/2017,3.0,The three stars are for the very friendly  helpful  charming staff  from the front desk to all the servers. Really nice people. I wish the quality of the food was as good as the quality of the staff. The spinach cheese dip was hard as a rock. Dip should be soft and luscious  not something you have to smash with your fork before you can eat it. Plus  it came in a ramekin so small  you could barely share it with anyone. They have great tortilla chips  but they all broke off in the dip because it was like cement. And the dip needs salsa on the side  because it's quite blandThe little $5.50 salad I had with it was okay. Decent ranch dressing. I would eat that again. The prices are reasonable. Valet parking  and free self-parking upstairs in their parking lot. The restroom was stinky and gross  with paper towels falling out of the trash can  which looked like it hadn't been emptied in a while. Do clean restrooms matter? They do to me. Not the worst place I've ever been  but I'm not planning to return. I'd like to give the staff jobs in a better restaurant!
Ruben N Olivia E.,Santa Maria  CA,27,11,1,5/13/2017,4.0,We loved BJ's in Oxnard so we tried this one in Burbank. The food is delicious we both had the steaks and they were great . The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the server didn't check in on us often to refill our drinks. We arrived and were seated right away. It was not packed for a Friday evening. Other than that it was great.
Michael B.,Sun Valley  CA,4,5,2,10/22/2016,1.0,After terrible service. JESSICA came to the rescue. And she ain't even a waitress. She's in take-out. Short staffLong wait Everything was good. Except for waiting an hour. If ur really hungry... don't come.
Jamilett M.,San Diego  CA,0,5,1,12/29/2016,1.0,WORST SERVICE! Waitress messed up everyones order  it was four of us about 10:30 pm  we were really hungry and she was even rude when we asked her to double check a beer we had asked for and when she finally gave up she came back and said that the server had poured the wrong drink. Honestly never had such bad service. Waitress name on receipt labeled as Jessie.
Ashley H.,Glendale  CA,0,9,1,8/22/2017,2.0,Food we good. However it took about 20 minutes to get some chips and guacamole. My daughters steamed veggies were hard  and obviously not cooked well. Service was very slow  especially for it being a weekday evening and it was not busy. I assume it was the kitchens fault and they need to get their act together.
Mel E.,Los Angeles  CA,9,176,176,4/11/2015,5.0,Good spot to come with family and friends. We sat down at the bar and right away approached by the bartender. He took our order and came back right away to serve us. They made sure we were taken cared of. If you are coming here as a group  do come in advance since it is a big family restaurant .
Brian S.,Sun Valley  CA,0,1,,3/29/2017,5.0,Best experience my wife and I've had in a long time Tyler was excellent and very friendly such a positive person
The G.,Glendale  CA,1,43,14,1/30/2017,1.0,bjs has changed quite a lot over the years. They have taken out all of their good food choices and now when u ask them to have the chef make a SIMPLE crispy chicken sandwich  they refuse. Highly disappointed.
Elizabet M.,Pacoima  Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,10/24/2017,1.0,I have not been to BJs in a while and this Sunday I remembered why..... they were not busy surprisingly but as the 2 1/2 hour outing proved I was slowly reminded why I stopped going. I went with my 2 kids and mom for a late Sunday lunch around 2:30. My kids order tenders and a pizza and of coarse they wanted cheese sticks. My mom asked for a cup of soup and shrimp tacos  I asked for a sandwich. We waited 30 minutes for the appetizer and soup on top of that my moms food was wrong waited about 45 minutes for my kids food and an HOUR for my sandwich and my moms tacos that they brought wrong..... my moms soup came cold BOTH times and we had to flag down a waiter in a group of servers talking and joking with someone that seemed to work there but was off the clock to get a refill on our drinks we waited 20 minutes for these refills. My youngest daughter did not like the pizza so I had to order solders for her.... not only did it take another 35 minutes but the server brought it in a to go plate knowing that we were waiting so could eat. This was just the beginning.... the server was nice about it and it was ok. Our total came out to 55.37. My mom gave 20 cash and I told the server he could put the rest on my card. Well I checked my account today and I was charged THREE times! One for the total 55.37  the second for 20.00 and the third for 34.37 I was furious because they didn't even tell me. I called Monday to speak to a manager to see what happens only to be placed on long holds both times I called. I kept getting cut off while I was trying to tell the manager what happens because he said he knew what happened.. really?? Nope never again worse service ever what a shame.
M M.,Arlington  TX,0,17,,4/27/2017,1.0,We come here often for the beer and HH specials. On the last visit  we ordered a Margarita. Big mistake! All shaved ice and lime juice. I have had stronger Slurpies or snow cones. Stick with the beer.
Rick R.,Los Angeles  CA,437,226,214,10/12/2015,4.0,Bj's is Bj's  and has lost its luster over the years; however  today's experience was much better than normal. Our server  Julia  provided top notch service.She was friendly (especially with the kids)  attentive  and professional. She could have served us stale bread and I would've still given the experience 4 stars.If everyone provided this level of customer service  the world would be a much better place. If you stop in to this location  do yourself a favor and request to be seated in her section.
Michael J.,Santa Monica  CA,82,62,33,7/27/2016,4.0,Came here randomly with my woman and had a beautiful lunch. I think Jeffery was our waiter and he was fast  professional and basically perfect. He didn't do anything extra  he seemed genuine and our food was terrific. I would definitely come here again especially with the free valet parking  as it just makes things much easier to handle when going out to eat.
Priscilla T.,SYLMAR  CA,102,40,22,10/4/2015,1.0,Parking was only available for valet $3.50 or parking across the street on street parking. Our wait was 47 minutes for a party of 10. It was pretty busy so we did understand the wait time. The woman's Bathroom were extremely dirty ; toilet paper all over the floor  2 stalls smelled like urine and one sink was out of soap. I know because I have 3 children and hey take turns visit the bathroom. Our server came and drop off the menus and immediately asked what we wanted to drink? (Hello  we just the menu...I say this because since we are in a water drought I don't want to order water unless if I plan to drink it  yet she offered a round of waters.) She came back 7-11 minutes later to drop off the waters and take our orders  given the fact it was our first time we had menu questions. She was able to answer 2 out of 7 of the questions due to lack of knowledge of the menu. Placed our order. Part of that order was a pitcher of beer. When our beer came it was warm and the beer glass was dirty. The order came out in half'  half the table had their soups meanwhile orders waited. By the time the other soups came the others had finished the their soup. Then our meals came out in that same order... Once we got all our meals  our server didn't come back to ask if everything was okay. We needed sides of blue cheese/ BBQ but she never came back so we had to look for another server. Finally  the desert came we ordered 4 pizookie  those came out and tasted good.Not sure if I would recommend this place maybe it was the server/ maybe it was that it was Sunday or maybe their isn't an excuse for service like this. $180 not well spent
Erick D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,23,4/15/2016,4.0,If you ever happen to stop by this BJs location in Burbank....make sure you have SHANNON be your server. She's Amazing!!!! I'm a regular here  there's never a day she's not in a great mood; just makes the experience and vibe extra chill! Just remember this name SHANNON :) She's definitely a reason why we come to BJ's and not the other local restaurants.P.S. white choc pazzuci is the best!!!
Salute U.,Burbank  CA,4637,254,281,11/11/2016,1.0,We came here on Veterans Day for the military meals that BJ's offers to vets and active military personnel. The service was VERY SLOW  there was no bread or breadsticks offered while we looked over the menu. In fact I had to ask for bread even though I had almost eaten my meal. The waiter never offered anything. Then a person who may have been the Manager came by our table to check on things. I expressed my irritation of their poor service to him and this knucklehead made no attempt to make things right. What an A hole. Don't come here otherwise you will be disappointed.
Cinderella R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,4,4/13/2017,5.0,I love this place!!!! There chicken alfredo is the best in town!!! Stephanie Martinez our server of the day was the cherry on top to a beautiful lunch! She's so caring and always on top of the game! And their garlic knots are to die for!! Will definitely be coming back in hope to get the same customer service!
Rosie G.,Burbank  CA,0,3,1,7/23/2017,2.0,This place has terrible service. We were a party of 6 and had to get up to ask for refills. Never again will we go back to this place. Lack of help!
Susan D.,Los Angeles  CA,49,115,58,7/29/2016,3.0,food is salty...ie the boneless hot wings...mini deep dish is 1/2 price on happy hour...you choose the ingredients....use your yelp check in for a free app offer...hot in here but beer is cold!
Kendall M.,Los Angeles  CA,95,109,1,11/30/2016,4.0,You know  I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I spend a fair amount of time in Burbank and although I've been to other BJ's before I hadn't been to this one yet. We couldn't spend Thanksgiving with my gramma  so we took her out to lunch a couple of days later  this place is really close to her home and she doesn't like to go far  so it worked well. I was expecting it to be loud because the freeway is so near  but it wasn't! We sat outside (there were dogs on the patio! my favorite thing) and it was lovely. Our server (Nikka? Oh  please forgive me for forgetting your name!) was sassy and nice  we were fans. My salad was enormous  and my beer was good! all in all it made for a really nice afternoon.
Karie F.,PORTER RANCH  CA,260,594,436,11/27/2016,4.0,Had a business meeting here. Great location  right off of the 5 fwy. Parking is available in the lot next to the restaurant  or you can valet for $3.50. Our waiter was top notch  such a kind person  even to other employees and bus people(forgot his name  uggh).But we visited on Friday at 2:30  if that helps. Very attentive and friendly. The food was great! Noise level was a lil bit too much but we were seated near the kitchen so maybe this was a factor. Booths are nice and roomy too. The bathroom was pretty dirty though. It smelled bad and had lots of garbage on the floors. This was a shame too because otherwise  the decor was nice. They also have a toddler toilet which is great for the kiddos  however  they don't have any kind of sign on the outside of the stall. So when I entered I had no idea until I was practically sitting on the floor. Overall it was a great visit and I would def recommend and come back!
Laura H.,Burbank  CA,380,148,440,7/15/2016,4.0,"I really enjoy BJ\'s because it\'s one of those ""there\'s something for everyone"" places  including a full bar. On weekend nights  there is a bit of a wait for a table  but it\'s usually not more than 30 minutes. Servers are consistently good! They are pleasant and rarely have gotten any orders wrong in all the years I\'ve been coming here. The drinks are great as well  especially the beers. There is valet parking  but also a free parking structure past the valet signs and to your right  but only after 5pm on weekdays and all day on weekends. Try the pizza and the pizookies- it\'s what they\'re known for!"
Promise R.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,30,10,,2/28/2017,4.0,Our server Heather was phenomenal! Always there when we needed her  and knowledgeable about the menu and bar!!
Batavia M.,Los Angeles  CA,526,75,73,2/14/2017,5.0,We had Valentines dinner at this Burbank BJ location and our server was KYLE M  he is the bomb  great customer service skills and multi tasking  management should give him a raisE PERIOD!!!!
Carrie S.,Burbank  CA,207,56,18,10/23/2016,2.0,"I will start with a positive  our server Sarah was so sweet. It was a Saturday afternoon and me and my friend just wanted a chill place to have a bite to eat & gab.Well  what used to be a spot to visit on occasion  this experience will definitely deter from that. Our food took quite a long time for a couple of sandwiches  one cold and one hot. When our food finally arrived  my french fries weren\'t what I ordered and my sandwich was cold. Sarah was kind to send it back to the kitchen and bring me hot and fresh fries while I waited for my fresh sandwich. I had ordered it WITHOUT BACON  I want that to be clear from the get-go! When my sandwich came back  it was hot but had bacon in it. That was unfortunate. I brought it my server\'s attention and she apologized profusely. She asked if a wanted another one and at that point  it wasn\'t worth it. I ordered the salad I should have ordered to begin when perusing the large menu of options.The manager came over and said ""I heard there was a problem with your sandwich and we\'ll take care of it for you."" I told him how the first one was cold  and the second one had bacon in it. He quipped ""It didn\'t."" Shocked by how the \'customer is always right\' didn\'t apply  I said  ""I know it did  sir."" He said  again  as matter of factly  ""I\'m telling you didn\'t."" Appalled by how rude this man was speaking to me  I said  ""I\'m telling you that it did."" And he then had the audacity to say  ""it was probably an overcooked piece of chicken that you mistook it for."" Whoa  are you kidding me? So now am I not only ""wrong"" but it\'s okay to serve a guest overcooked meat?! Wow. I tried to keep the smile on my face and not the show the disgust I felt in the pit of my stomach. He then walked away. Off the look of my friend  who was equally mortified  I asked if I had come off to him in any way that would warrant him to speak to me so passive aggressive and condescending  and she said ""no."" I flagged our server over and thanked her  and mentioned that the manager had come over to address the food issues  by being beyond rude to me as a customer and basically called me a liar. She also was extremely apologetic. So sir  I now know you\'re the GM of that location and I will let your corporate office know what a jerk you were to a customer. The fact of the matter is this  I don\'t go out to eat often but when I do  I expect great service from top to bottom. The kitchen doesn\'t have it\'s stuff together because they messed up the order three times. Your food runners should get the food to the table faster so it\'s hot when served  then I suppose this situation wouldn\'t have happened to begin with. TRULY disappointed  and will NOT return to this location and will tell others to do the same."
George B.,Modesto  CA,7,16,1,8/27/2016,1.0,Avoid this restaurant. They brought us cold food and spaghetti with no sauce. They did nothing to rectify the situation. Go somewhere else.Wish I could give zero stars.
Manuel A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,63,28,2/20/2017,1.0,I can't put negative stars but if I could I would. The worst service I have ever experienced. Went with friends. Took 2 and a half hours from the moment we arrived until the moment we left because the service was extremely slow. The pizza we ordered was cold. The drinks never came on time. We wanted to pay separately they didn't make that happen. Just the worst experience of my life. I even had nightmares of this place. Please don't go there HORRIBLE. GOOD THING they're going to open a yard house down the street in a few months def going to do business with them. Wish i could campaign to not waste your money on this horrible service joint. Had better expectations about this place I can't believe they did my friends and I this way.
Scott D.,Burbank  CA,20,36,1,3/25/2017,2.0,We love the food but they have way too few self parking spaces. Don't like to be forced to valet. There were a large number of spaces but all reserved for the valets.
Justin P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,12/9/2016,1.0,If I could  I'd give zero stars. I took my girlfriend here for her bday because she loves pizookies. The servers were friendly enough but the service time was awful and when we ordered our pizookie  it took over 30 minutes. When we finally received it  it was heavily overcooked and pretty much inedible. They gave us a free pizookie coupon but it wasn't nearly enough compensation for the poor overall service we received. We certainly won't be going back to this location and will very likely not be visiting any other any time soon.
Aneta K.,Chatsworth  CA,0,13,,3/31/2017,1.0,If I can give no stars I would. This is the second time I've been here this month and it's been an absolute disappointment... I was here beginning of this month and there was hair in my food.. and today here I am again (because my daughter loves the food here) and I get my food and the rice is cold as ice. I'm lactose intolerant and they brought my re-made jambalaya with a bit of cheese in there.
Yonatan O.,Porter Ranch  CA,0,2,,2/20/2017,1.0,My girlfriend and I were here on a Sunday night around 9:30pm  we put our name on the list as we are waiting we see the hostess sit 2 couples who came in after we did  no big deal it must have been a simple mistake. We finally order they bring our drinks and we are told they ran out of artichoke dip which was why we decided to go to this place on the first place  my girlfriend was pretty annoyed  at that point I decide to order a coffee  after 10 min I still had not get my coffee I see our server and reminded her about my coffee  a couple minutes latter the finally bring it to me without a spoon to stir it with  I ask someone and they bring me a dirty soup spoon so at that moment we decide to get up and leave... terrible costumer service
Michelle F.,Studio City  CA,28,134,129,11/11/2016,1.0,Unfortunately I had to even rate them. Immediately greeted upon entering. We waited 15 minutes while 3 waitress/waiter were talking personal business behind us then another 5 waitress /waiters at the other end of the isle talking. No acknowledgement. No eater. No drinks. Place is not busy. First & last time here. Wasted money on valet
Stacy R.,Burbank  CA,0,82,3,5/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Ordered for take out that I was told to pick up in 15 min...what a lie! Order wasn't complete and pizza got cold and waited another 30+ minutes for their kitchen to get the sandwich. Lousy food. Waste of money.
Narek D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,,11/18/2016,1.0,"What happened to this place?!? Decided to go have lunch here past weekend and I gotta tell you worst experience ever  I used to love this place but now it seems like it\'s hit rock bottom. Service sucked  food was horrible and took 45 minutes for food to come out server didn\'t seem to care  after food came out the side dish was missing so didn\'t get the full order after mentioning it to the server she said they\'re bringing out and next thing you know they didn\'t bring the side I order complete different from what I had asked for I didn\'t even want to bother anymore after that I let it be  after the food I wanted to order dessert server comes and hands me the check which I hadn\'t asked for yet and when I tried to order dessert ""oh we don\'t have that today we ran out"" on 3 different desserts I asked for. I won\'t be coming back here again!"
Michelle L.,Sylmar  CA,0,5,1,8/12/2016,1.0,"This location is awful! After talking to people about my experience here  I couldn\'t believe how many other people had problems!I was extremely ripped off and the orders were ALL wrong!!The take out order consisted of 3 burgers and 1 pazookie. I have been to other locations so I knew what to expect. However  the order was not what I was expecting. 2 burgers were ordered with no tomatoes  they both had tomatoes. Some people are allergic to tomatoes. 1 burger was ordered on sourdough. Their ""sourdough"" was regular sandwich bread with grill marks on it! 1 burger was ordered with cheese (which is $1 EXTRA!) and there was NO CHEESE! but we were still charged for it.The pazookie was extremely disappointing. I\'ve had delicious pazookies before so I was very excited to indulge and share it. When I opened the cookie  I was shocked!! The cookie was burnt and tiny!! It was about half the tin which it usually completely fills up. I basically paid $7 for a chips ahoy cookie.I only gave this review a generous 1 star (not that I could give it any less) because the food was still good. I just wish they paid more attention to get it right. So many things went wrong here. Very disappointed in this location."
Lynsie L.,Los Angeles  CA,34,23,3,5/26/2016,2.0,I guess we went on a busy night. Service was slooow. Our waiter was a nice guy but you could tell he was way in over his head.We ordered at 9 and our food didn't come out until 9:50... ridiculous. I have never experienced this  I wanted to cry I was so hungry haha. While we were waiting our waiter didn't even let us know the status of our food so we were just aimlessly waiting.What makes it worse is that people who were sat way after us received their food before us. Infuriating! One of them was a large group too.. they really need to work on their serving techniques here.When it came out the food was good  not worth almost an hour wait though.If you come here  don't come at 9pm on a friday. Also  the Pazookis are a must. Best part of the whole night.
Uncle L.,VALLEY VILLAGE  CA,218,98,,3/27/2016,2.0,"This place is the very definition of mediocrity as far as eating at any sort of chain restaurant. (Yard house  TGI Fridays  etc) Typical ""wait staff doesn\'t give a shit "" sat for 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Another 10 minutes at least til the drinks came. Waitress barely checked on us  didn\'t see her again til we were ready for the check. (Had to flag her down every time) Food was bland and thrown together; boneless chicken wings looked and tasted like they had come out of a microwave. (They barely took the time to toss them in wing sauce  most of them were half covered) No presentation  no passion whatsoever. Just everything thrown onto plates like you got up at 3am and nuked leftovers  then sat down to watch an episode of Roseanne until ""the spins"" wore off because you drank too much. The lighting in this place sucks  I don\'t know why it\'s so bright. It\'s a lot of rocks & wood ""ale house"" motif  yet have it lit up like a surgical theater. I don\'t know why there was a 20 minute wait when easily 1/4 of the restaurant was obviously available for seating  empty tables and even whole sections all over the place. The parking ramp is a nightmare  it\'s horribly designed and way too small. Trying to eat out anywhere in LA is just abysmal  the service sucks 90% of the time anywhere you go  because it\'s people that don\'t give a shit about their job or the customer service  they\'re just there until they find something better or get that role in a sitcom they moved here for. This BJ\'s reeked of that attitude  ""sit down  eat  pay  get the fuck out."" It had all the ambience and passion of a school cafeteria.The one in Canoga Park was always good  but haven\'t been there in years. This is the 2nd and last time I\'ll ever eat at the Burbank one."
Johnny J.,San Mateo  CA,0,5,,11/12/2016,1.0,Horrible fckn service. Took forever for them to tell us that they're out of meatballs. My wife's dinner came out first. About 10 mins after that they finally told us that they're out of meatballs. My daughter and I still waiting for our food. The place wasn't even packed. They had the audacity to charge me full bill?! Fck this place!
Robert B.,Carmel  NY,25,20,,2/20/2017,2.0,Reasonable food for the money  but playing fast pop music was driving everyone crazy and service was slow. Zagat rates music and noise as number 2 complaint  so why lose customers? I'm aware that studies show more noise makes people leave sooner  but keep in mind that after two visits we probably won't be back. I'm 53 and my wife is 48. But my partner is in his late 20's and won't go to BJs due to noise. My son was annoyed and he's 12! Noise is elevated because now customers are talking louder to be heard. Conversely we went to Outback the other day. It was just as crowded  but they had the music turned down so it was still pleasant. I think we'll have to take BJ's off our list and warn others off on Yelp. If you do go to BJs  don't go when there's any chance it will be crowded.
Randolph M.,Burbank  CA,0,5,1,2/18/2017,1.0,Wasn't expecting this for my damn birthday! All i wanted was a good dinner! Bad service 110% food wasnt cooked well  my plate looks like it was sitting out for a long time! Not satisfied at all! WHAT HAS THIS RESTAURANT BECOME! waiters need to step up their game and take care of their customers and tables regardless how bad theyre busy! Shake my head! Better off eating hot dog from 711 and wouldve enjoyed way better !
Haley K.,San Jose  CA,496,405,707,7/21/2015,3.0,I love BJ's Restaurant...usually. I actually had just visited the San Diego location only a week prior  so I'm definitely a fan. Can't go wrong with their oreo poozokie and their deep dish pizza's!My family was in town and staying at the Marriott in Burbank  walking distance to this location. We figured why not grab some dinner there. We all love this place  so it was perfect. I called ahead to make sure we didn't have to wait too long  since it was a Friday evening. We got there  put our name in and only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated in a big booth. Perfect!Our waiter was great. He was super attentive and I could tell running around to make sure everyone was pleased  but apparently there were some kitchen issues. I'm glad we opted away from ordering a deep dish pizza (got the flat bread to start  which was good)  because the large table next to us had ordered 2 large deep dish pizzas and apparently had been there for almost 2 hours waiting. They were accommodating  giving them free salads and making sure they were happy  but still! My dad got the fish and chips  and my mom and I decided to split the avocado egg rolls and the shrimp scampi. She had ordered it before and enjoyed it  and I had been wanting to try it. When it came out  it looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I'm not one to send food back  but it was horrible. No flavor at all. I felt bad since I knew they were stressing out with the kitchen issue  but I also didn't think we should pay $17 for something we didn't touch more than a few bites. The manager came out and was nice. Asked if we wanted to try something else or would like a poozkie  but at that time it was late  we had an appetizer and ate the eggrolls  so we were fine. We also didn't want to be stuck waiting for anything else. I'm not sure I would go back to that location  but I will give this place 3 stars because the service was great. The food  ehhhh.
Benjamin S.,Los Angeles  CA,455,452,191,6/5/2015,3.0,I've been coming to this BJ's since it opened as I was one of the original servers hired on back in 2000 when they opened. I respect the company tremendously and it's been interesting to watch their menu change over the years (and sadly  the price of the pizzookie go up... oh inflation!) Back in April my wife had her birthday and since she's part of the BJ's club  she gets a free pizzookie so she thought to make life easy on us all  we'd just have a pizza and pizzookie for dinner that night and do it takeout style. She called at 4:30 in the afternoon to have the host tell her he was too busy to take her order and that she'd have to call back in an hour. Had he said that to me  I would have given him an earful  asked to speak with the manager  given them an earful and made sure never to return to this restaurant again. Remember  I worked for BJ's and I KNOW this is unacceptable. My wife was annoyed  but she really wanted pizza and a pizzookie (she's pregnant) so she called back an hour later.Picks up the pizza  comes home  and on our Sweet Pig  there was very few 'sweets' or 'pigs' meaning very little pineapple or ham. There was also hardly any sauce on the pizza so it was super dry and a thin layer of cheese. Again  I worked at BJ's and never saw a pizza look like this. Then  our chocolate cookie for the pizzookie was burnt to a crisp on the outside  and raw on the inside. What the heck?! This is not cool ever  but for someone's birthday meal? I call BJ's and ask to speak to the manager. I really want to remember his name correctly  I believe it was Mark (he was fairly new and had only worked at BJ's for a few months.) Mark turned the whole situation around. He was extremely apologetic and asked us to come into the restaurant as his treat to compensate for this nightmare of an experience. We worked out the day and time.Came in and was seated. Our server was very friendly  but pretty slow and forgot several requests (lemons for our ice water  to go boxes etc.) We touch base with Mark and he did a great job dealing with us. Meal was on the house and a bit of faith was restored in the Burbank BJ's location. Good to see it's not going down the tubes 15 years later.
Alysha T.,Los Angeles  CA,2,51,31,6/8/2016,1.0,Let's start off the review with how we got seated in a pretty crappy section  right by their extra back door and a servers pos station. Every other minute a busser  a server on a smoke break  or a customer being directed out by servers. So every 5 seconds the light was shining in on me and my boyfriend face and eyes  the constant door opening and shutting was getting pretty irritating because the light was in and out of our eyes every other second and it was actually getting pretty warm too. OH And the kicker was how loud that table was  the servers literally yelling at the pos station behind my head  the ridiculous noises coming from outside  and the overall noise of the restaurant. Ok whatever  not that big of a deal right? My table was sticky  ok still not a big deal. Our server was polite  and suggested us the queso dip  it came out DELICIOUSSS.What wasn't delicious was the fruit fly/knat that was in it. Ok whatever. It happens. It's a knat  it's tiny it happens when doors get opened. We've all eaten worse. No big deal for me  and this queso dip is the bomb. We get our I believe it was some sort of guacamole bacon or avocado bacon burger  it was pretty basic nothing special at all  and rather bland to be honest  patty did not seem seasoned with even salt or pepper. We also had a meat lovers pizza of some sort  also again basic  on the greasy side  and the crust was on the rubbery spectrum of crust  and wasn't delivered with any sort of utensil to actually cut the pizza just our butter knives and forks with our silverware  although servers were constantly behind me not one of them would stop talking to each other long enough to realize I've had my head turned waving my hand in their face asking for some sort of pizza cutter or anything really  that was more helpful to actually cut the pizza. Once I was finally noticed they sent a server running to grab one she then sliced it for us. Now desert  the whole reason we all come to BJS right! We now have another server a very awkward  timid server  we basically had to offer ourselves a menu to her  to choose our pizzookies!We got a trio  they sounded amazing and I've eaten at a couple different BJS and have always had the best experiences with their pizzookies  The only issue was that the cookie was barely luke warm at most on arrival. It reminded me of a sad microwaved Von's cookie that lost any sort of the heat by the time they actually got it to the table. Kinda bummed  considered still going back for desert again sometime. Until it hit about 10 PM and I felt uncomfortably sick to my stomach  my boyfriend was asleep and woke up around 12 AM feeling exactly the same  and now I'm sure we will NOT GO BACK to this location whatsoever and possibly the chain as a whole because of how bad this experience was  during  and after. You would think with SEVERAL quality restaurants in the area and a couple opening with outstanding reputations  they would really amp up the service and standards.
Dro E.,Glendale  CA,0,24,2,10/30/2016,3.0,"Ok i\'m confused about this place! Got here on Saturday at 1 pm. As soon as i turned into bjs parking lot 1 man rushed into my car trying to grab my car. I could guess it was the valet parking guy but if you guys have self-parking there  don\'t assume whoever comes in is going to leave his car there and let you park it! Maybe he can park himself! Please teach your workers to not kill themselves for $5 tip!!!! Then he made me feel bad that i dont wanna give him my car! Afterwards  he started talking to his coworkers and both were staring at me!!!such an idiot!Our waiter was nice! Little tooo extra nice that we could feel how fake he is but still better than other workers! I ordered a classic cheese burger which you couldn\'t find on the menu but the waiter said ""i got you."" Later on i found out what ""i got you"" really means! I got a burger with only the meet! And took them another 6-7 minutes to add the rest on the burger while the meat was cold when i got it back! In addition  he kept asking us if we want any desert! 3 times! Wtf!!! My gf felt really bad so did 3 stars only because he told us stupid jokes and made us laugh."
Yohanna P.,Burbank  CA,0,8,,7/11/2017,1.0,Love the food at BJ's but this location service sucks. My friend and I got only checked on once by our waiter. It wasn't even that busy. We had to ask for our refills. Took probably about 20 mins to get our check. When we asked for our check she said our bills were the same so if we wanted to give her our credit cards and when I told her no we wanted the bill to our table she made a face. Get way better service at the one in Glendale. She gave the tables next to and in front of us better one on one service and they both got their checks before us and boxes and they were here way after us.
Abe M.,Burbank  CA,20,61,17,2/5/2017,1.0,Ok. Where do I start? Last time I was there  the waitress took our order and never came back. Someone else came and dropped off our food and we never saw anyone else til we asked for the check. When I complained to the manager on the way out  she didn't seem to care and we left. This time was even worse. The fish came over cooked and tasted terrible. It was more grease than ever and the vegetables were old and tasted rotten as you can see in the picture. That wasn't the worst part. We sat near the kitchen and I had to look the other way become I was soooo grossed out. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I eat out at least 4 times a week at fancy restaurants and I guess you can't compare them the BJ's but that's no excuse. Obviously the manager in not doing her job. She doesn't seem to care. I am attaching pictures so you can see for yourself. I will never eat at BJ's again. I don't think anyone else will if they ever see the kitchen. I wonder how many insects are walking around in that condition.
Matthew J.,Glendale  CA,32,62,3,4/1/2016,1.0,"For whatever reason there\'s valet. You can drive past them to get to the structure that is right next to where the valets park your car.The wait on the weekend can be long. Overall the staff is decent and the food is on par with the other Bjs I\'ve been to.The past two times I\'ve gone here they have either not accepted my phone number for the rewards points because ""it\'s a hassle""  or told me I was good to go only for me to find later that the points weren\'t added. Missing a couple of points isn\'t usually a problem. But this happened to be when the bills were $160 and $250 respectively.This is the only branch that has given me this much of a problem. I\'d rather them tell me that they just don\'t accept the rewards system so wouldn\'t have to play ""will they or won\'t they""."
Megan Alexis G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,4,,6/22/2017,5.0,RYAN J IS THE BEST SERVER EVER!!!!! He's so sweet!!!!! Even tho we were literally the last ones left  he was so accommodating & didn't rush us at all. :)
sweetie p.,Los Angeles  CA,0,34,1,6/7/2017,2.0,Is it me or has the food gone downhill here? The pizza is terrible  the avocado rolls were a mixture of other things than avocado  they keep changing everything..even the fries. Not happy with the companies changes. It sucks now.
terry s.,Burbank  CA,11,57,24,9/25/2016,2.0,I will never come back here!!!!! Service was deplorable  we waited 35 min for our food. My pasta was very bland. Can't wait for my check & go home. The $10.00 off coupon my friend has is not worth it!!!!!
Bryan R.,Los Angeles  CA,144,1,,9/26/2016,1.0,"Patrick you suck at your job you should get fired . We went for my brothers birthday and we saw others get treated so nicely for their birthdays they sang for them and had a nice candle on their dessert   PATRICK came to our table threw the cookie down on the table as if he was mad and just said ""here"" and left so me and my friend just sang happy birthday for my brother instead. ""GREAT SERVICE"" 25 min for some water. First trump now this."
Erik D.,Los Angeles  CA,80,27,5,10/2/2016,5.0,Christian is the man! really good waiter. Good service all around. Pizooki was the ish!!

Phil S.,Burbank  CA,213,59,20,8/31/2016,1.0,Only ordered about 5 items and out of the 5 three were sent back. Steak was extra salty which they took off the bill. Waiter messed up on the pizza and acknowledged it and still tried to charge me until I called him out. Won't be coming back here again
Jeff K.,Los Angeles  CA,0,20,,6/28/2017,4.0,Attentive service  great menu options including healthy entrees. Meals did not disappoint and BJs is a great value. Plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. I recommend this BJs location.
Arineh S.,La Crescenta  CA,0,3,,6/18/2017,3.0,Bj's food is always great! However  the front host who was taking our name for our seating tried to make us wait longer when he didn't even call our name text us or give us a beeper notifying that our table was ready. He tried lying saying that he did notify us. He also tried making us wait an additional 30 min. Not cool.
Deborah M.,Burbank  CA,0,3,,3/4/2017,1.0,"Worst dining experience ever! Waited over an hour for food and was told two of our six meals were almost ready. Asked for the manager and when we explained we had been waiting so long and our two toddlers were starving  she replied ""I know  we\'re backed up."" No I\'m sorry  no let me make it up to you  she took no ownership at all. We finally got the kids Mac n Cheese and what a surprise they were cold. The drink orders weren\'t much better. The waiter told us that the drinks were delivered to the wrong table so we had to wait until they made new ones. Never did get all of our meals. Will never go here again!"
Daryl P.,Pasadena  CA,121,17,,11/13/2016,1.0,BJ's allocates entirely too much parking to valet. The restaurant is not even packed  but I have to wait around for people to leave. It's like like more than half the parking is valet.

Zoie H.,Los Angeles  CA,2268,800,1533,3/14/2014,4.0,I need to start off with the highlight of the evening: The BJ's Berry Cider. Oh My gosh  it was super delicious (amazing berry flavor)  and super crisp and refreshing. I had a pint of it by itself and a pint of it combined with the Jeremiah Red Stout (called a Jerry Berry). So worth it! Beyond amazing!The trip to BJ's was part of Tyler and I's date night. It's hard working graveyard shift to actually have nights out so this was perfect and well needed! We treated ourselves to some Santa Fe Spring Rolls (good sized portion for the price)  and we both had burgers (he had the jalapeno burger and loved it  I had the regular BJs Brewhouse burger - both with fries)  and of course we had to have a giant cookie topped with ice cream! (we had the new salted caramel one  it was worth every single calorie and pound of fat that I am sure to gain!)Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. They have valet parking  but if you go to the second level of the parking structure it's try your luck for spaces self-parking.I want to go back  mainly for the berry cider and giant cookies. That could totally be a meal right?!
Arik T.,Los Angeles  CA,131,186,396,2/28/2016,5.0,"Always a pleasure. Other than the parking situation this BJ\'s is great! It\'s huge and the servers are always on point  the drinks are always good  and the food is always fresh. The location is huge so it get\'s a little loud but there really isn\'t a bad seat in the house  there are TV\'s everywhere so you\'re pretty well covered in that aspect. I highly recommend the new ""Monkey bread pizookie"" it really blew me away! I will definitely be back!"
Monica M.,Downtown  Los Angeles  CA,309,43,46,6/11/2015,2.0,Are you serious? Lol. The stuffed mushrooms keep getting smaller and smaller as time goes by lol. Flavor: it's alright.. Kinda dry since they're so tiny and whatever. Little mini mushrooms lol.
Flower P.,Sylmar  CA,0,16,6,12/30/2016,3.0,"I had an EXCELLENT experience here many moons ago maybe about 5 years ago. But the few times I\'ve gone this year have been from bad to so-so. The waiters and food is not up to par. I rather go to the one in Woodland Hills. It almost seems like they are annoyed with every new customer that walks in. Didn\'t bring us napkins/silverware until we asked  cold food  waiter seemed like he was trying to rush us out giving us the bill when we still wanted dessert plus not good knowledge on the beers we were asking about. It is a brewery as well  right? Just a very ""blah"" place. BTW none of the times were ""busy"" days."
Cheryl A.,Burbank  CA,0,2,,12/11/2016,1.0,This review is mainly for their to go service and the food quality.I ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and a pizookie via online ordering and for a specified time. When I arrived at the designated time  I waited. 20 minutes came and went and I still waited. It was a Saturday night and extremely busy  so even though they were given over an hour to heat up soup and a cookie  I can maybe understand the wait. It still isn't ideal  but I'm pretty reasonable. I got home (5 min drive)  opened my food and the soup was cold and the cookie was the wrong order and BARELY cooked. It was just mushy and completely disappointing.This isn't the first disappointing experience that I have had at this location with their curbside delivery service. Undercooked steak. Undercooked pizza. I'm seeing a theme here... I won't be back to this location.
Martin S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,14,,9/15/2016,1.0,Terrible service from the beginning. Our waiter was completely rude not one smile since we arrived and sat down to order. I had to ask serval times for my beer and when it was finally brought to me after 15 minutes of waiting  I received my beer in a dirty warm glass with spots all over the glassware. Also when we ordered all our food was brought out at different times when we all ordered together  why each plate had to come 15 minutes apart from each other is extremely odd and when I asked the waiter what was going on with the long wait  he simply ignored us and walked away. Food was ridiculous and undesirable  way too greasy  bland  and overpriced for the quality you actually get.
Mi P.,Compton  CA,133,45,24,11/22/2016,1.0,Made an order online in order to a ovoid the wait when picking up food items. Arrive to the restaurant and they seemed to never have received my order even after i got a confirmation number via email and everything. Manager didnt even bother apologizing on their part and i still had to wait for my food. Point of ordering online is to nothave to wait for my food! I have ordered online at pther Bjs and never had this happened to me. Never coming back to this location. What a dissapointment on management and customer service.
Christina C.,Los Angeles  CA,240,140,2,8/9/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I'm really disappointed to say that I've been coming to this BJ's for the last 4 years that I've lived in Burbank  and each experience has blatantly and steadily declined in quality.Last weekend  a small group of us (5 total) came in for a birthday dinner at around 6:30pm. We were seated at a high top in the bar area since there were lots of empty tables. We got our drinks in a timely manner and proceeded to order our entrees (a salad  a small plate of wings  chicken tacos  lemon tyme chicken  and a burger). We talked and hung out....and realized that AN HOUR has passed by and we haven't gotten our food yet. Checked in with the server  and she assured us the food was on its way. 15-20 mins later  the food arrived  except for the burger. The 4 of us were almost done eating when we had to remind the server that we were still missing the burger. 20 mins later  the server came over with the burger  and to collect our empty plates :( A very nice manager came over and asked us if our food was alright  and that he would take off the burger from the bill and offered us complimentary Pazookis  which was unexpected! We probably should've left at this point because the 3 mini pazookis took well over 30-40 mins to arrive. The whole dinner took about 2.5 hours  and the restaurant wasn't at capacity by any means. When we were finally able to flag down our server  we were charged incorrectly  and the desserts were charged as well. At this point  instead of having the bill fixed  we bit the bullet and paid it so we could leave as soon as possible.Bottom line: It was probably a warning sign when all 5 of us started to realize we've all had horrible previous experiences here and traded stories. Honestly  the food is really great  but DON'T expect decent service AT. ALL.
Disraili G.,Burbank  CA,1,48,,3/5/2017,1.0,Let me start with that my wife and I eat out regularly. Maybe as much as 3 times a week. We have been to almost every restaurants in Burbank. Yet we don't go to BJ's that often. My wife suggested I get the ribeye. As I love a good steak. So we order. My wife gets strawberry lemonade and I got sunset peach ice tea. Got the drinks and my wife has that yuk look on her face after the first drink. The drink was so sweet it was like drinking double the sugar this drink should have. My wife ordered some sort of shrimp dinner. She order an appitizer mushroom. It was pretty good and there was a lot of them. I ordered a clam chowder soup. I thought it was pretty good. My wife said it was a bit salty. But she still ate some anyway. Now we get the main dishes. My wife food was great. Now my food  I taste the mash potatoes and its bland. I think ok fine. I taste the steak and it has huge chunks of salt on top. I know a good steak need salt bit this is rediculous amount of salt. My wife tried it and said she can taste the salt even after having some of her drink. I tell the waiter. He takes it back. It takes a long time as they had to cook another. By then I had another ice tea. Now I'm full and didn't even get to have steak. The waiter offered me more food. I turned him down and got the steak to go. For a steak meal I was disappointed all the way around. $62 for a meal for 2 with no alcoholic drinks. Think I will pass on the steak here. As well will think twice before I come for a meal again. Who ever cooks and prepared the strawberry lemonade needs to have their taste buds checked with a doctor as this is rediculous.
Ana V.,Los Angeles  CA,5,22,1,10/23/2016,2.0,Don't order curbside. Wasn't ready it was supposed to be....what's the point of it if I have to wait outside door in the cold and in the rain? Also  pizza was less than their usual. And their avocado rolls had more chipotle sauce than avocado... The rolls tasted like mayo I suggest the Pasadena location
Daisy C.,Northridge  Los Angeles  CA,6,45,6,4/16/2016,5.0,Its the second time i visit this location. The first time i ordered pizza i can't remember if it was good or not. I went yesterday again and i ordered chicken alfredo and a lemonade. The chicken alfredo was so good! It's a large portion i couldn't finish it so the price of 15.95 is not bad at all. However the lemonade was not good at all. It was sour. Service was very great very welcoming young lady and had no problem exchanging our cold food. Thank you!
Amina's J.,Burbank  CA,52,36,21,4/23/2016,3.0,Great place for a drink... their chilled Patron shots are like triple shots. And the selections of veers and occasional local featured beers is always refreshing. Usually don't have a complaint about this place  which is why we return even after the mishap I'm about to explain.Now... one of their downfalls is an obvious breakdown in the kitchen. For a family who does not eat beef  it was disheartening to be served clam chowder bowls with chili chunks in it  not once but TWICE in the same meal. Seems like some jack ass in the kitchen did not give enough thought to cross contaminating the soups  and after being told by the manager that he changed the entire clam chowder container  the replacement had chili beans in it too! After pointing this out  I ordered a grilled cheese with shoestring fries and they attempted to charge me for the soup AS WELL AS the grilled cheese. Needless to say  a simple discussion with the waitress and she made sure all of it was removed from the bill. It seems like over time  this place is starting to struggle with basic food prep errors  but still a great atmosphere overall. And despite some of their pitfalls  management usually goes out of their way to fix issues and make accommodations to show their apologies instead of it just being lip service.
Lilit P.,Glendale  CA,0,5,1,6/14/2017,4.0,We ordered for pick up. Food was good but they forgot to put the sauces for the salad. We ended up eating a dry salad. Make sure when you call for pick up you remind them for what you need!
Dominic P.,Los Angeles  CA,24,176,31,10/24/2016,5.0,Great job all around. From the comfort food  to the level of service. Nicest male waiter one could ask for during lunch. Very polite and professional hostess as well. Was unaware of the valet so I was a little disappointed in that I didn't have any cash to tip the valet. Will certainly return.
Michael P.,Sussex  NJ,3,29,3,10/23/2016,3.0,Ok food; feels like an Applebee's. If you want an ok meal for a reasonable price with little atmosphere you've come to the right place.
Michael B.,Burbank  CA,34,8,,5/8/2017,2.0,"First i want to say that the food is really good. So why am i give only 2 stars? When my group arrived we came in 2 cars there was only parking for 1 so we asked the valet guy if there was any other palce to park the car  he said no and that we had to go somewhere else to park. Since we were on short time limit we paid for the valet  but they didnt park our car  we parked it ourselves. We didnt have to wait long to be seated and the waiter was very nice and patient. We get our drinks and food in a decent time. We shared a plate of some noodles (i dont remember what the plate was called). I get my fork and wrap the noddles around and eat it. As i am eating i feelvsomething a little hard amd thought it might be a bone. I pull it out and see that it is a metal tie that you get on your beard or tortillas. I wasnt mad or looking for blood but when our waiter passed by i informed him of it and he apologized and said he would inform the manager. We continue and about 10 minutes later someone with the plate and metal tie come to the table and asks who ordered it. We saod we were sharing the plate but i was the one that pulled it out of my mouth. He tells us the he was cofused cause he says the dont use those types of tie but imstaed have the ones that look kind of like guitar picks. We all look at each other and he asked ""well what do we want?"" We said we dont want anything  just take the plate off our check. I was the first one to take a bite so the plate was almost still there. He kept insist that they dont have that tie. We told him that we work in customer service and didnt want to cause any problem just to let them know what happen. He looks at me and says ""well you would be suprised at what people in customer service will do to get free stuff."" That got me mad. To accuse us of tryimg to get a free meal is horrible to say. But he kept on asking if we wanted anything. We also came to realize that he is the chef not the manager. So why is he coming out and the manager not. Horrible place to go to and by looking at other reviews im not the only one."
Joyce F.,Burbank  CA,0,2,,5/21/2017,1.0,I placed a take out order and was told to pick up in 15-20 minutes. After I arrived  I waited another 30 minutes because the order wasn't complete. And meanwhile the pizza got cold. Lousy food and a waste of money.
Louie B.,Sylmar  CA,68,38,22,5/20/2016,1.0,Everything I ordered is salty except the glass of waterthe ribs and steak is salty  the mash potato is salty too much cheese  the asparagus they're over cook and they did not cut the top part  the clam chowder as well is too salty. The fish is salty and the shrimp too. This is my first time here and this will be my last time as well
C H.,North Hollywood  CA,0,14,3,5/11/2017,3.0,I like sitting in the patio during summer eves. Food is ok. Big menu so lots of choices. Beers are good. Great place to watch sports!
Gohar S.,Burbank  CA,11,37,45,3/18/2016,2.0,I hadn't been to BJ's for a while  but it still remains a 2 star restaurant as how I remember it. The service was extremely slow. It was a Friday night  not as busy as we expected  we didnt have to wait at all for a table  but why was the service so slow? Who knows. We ordered a pizza and salad  the pizza was not bad  but the salad didnt taste fresh and crisp  alot of wilted lettuce pieces. They really need to up their game with Woodranch opening across the street. Also  they force the valet parking on you  there is a lot they use but 90% of the spaces are reserved for the valet  not too reasonable.
Lorin M.,Los Angeles  CA,426,37,75,7/26/2016,5.0,This place gets 5 stars just for the host named Alex who was extremely nice and welcoming today.
Chris G.,Los Angeles  CA,93,148,24,5/19/2015,4.0,Came here for a friends birthday dinner. Parking: valet requires gratuity. Or you can self park and walk all of 200 yards.Restaurant: clean and pretty spacious. No funny odors  except delicious food.Staff: the waitress handled our table of 9 great. She definitely was not a rookie. Only con is that she didn't smile the whole time. Little things like that matter to me  but eh maybe wasn't the best day for herFood: I've order quite a few things here. This time ordered burger. Was made right. Decent portion.Wasn't too crowded  but definitely not empty. It was Monday nightHow can I forget that pazookie. Man that thing has crack in it. I said I wasn't going to order one  but my friend offered some and I ate half. O_OI would definitely come back.
Mike K.,TOLUCA TER  CA,0,28,1,4/1/2016,1.0,Please stay away from this place. Horrible food and long waits. Driest pizza on earth  no cheese and their online order messed up my order. I've been here maybe 6 times and never was amazed. Cheese factory is better. I'm so disappointed  I'm just sorry I left a tip. i should have left something else. The chiefs need to be thought how to cook by Gordon Ramsay. Ps: shrimp on the side was good ._.
Sanka D.,Los Angeles  CA,256,12,1,7/30/2016,5.0,Had a GREAT dinner here tonight! Our waiter Jonathon was Wonderful and on Top of it. Dale's steak was over cooked and he had the manager come over to personally apologies for the error and completely remade his dinner. And for the trouble they gave us our appetizers on the house. I recommend the BJ'S to everyone! Great employees and WONDERFUL Manager Mark!!!!
Jim L.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,0,20,3,4/29/2016,5.0,Great place for lunch. Service at the sports bar is fantastic! Claudia is really top notch. She cares! She is helpful! She is very personable and friendly. She helps find the lowest cost combination when my wife and I are looking to split a meal because we know we cannot eat two meals. We almost always sit at the bar corner so the three or four of us can talk to each other. We're usually early in the lunch period  so the bar area is reasonably quiet  important for us.Claudia gives her space around the bar a lot of personality and makes everyone feel like family.Edgard  who runs the Valet Service which is FREE (no charge)  is also a super personable friendly guy. He really welcomes you to HIS establishment and sets the tone for a great welcoming.We just love going to BJ's often for lunch.FOOD? A great variety. Complained only once when the Brocoli & Cheese soup only had a few green specs in it! Now  there is always plenty of brocoli in it. Beef dip great! Thin fries are very very good.
Victoria M.,Visalia  CA,0,11,,1/22/2017,2.0,We waited to be seated for about 30mins as they were pretty busy. When we were seated it took them another 15mins to take our drink order. Our waitress was nice but I was not impressed with this place. Our food took forever to come out and when it finally did  it was cold.
Hasmik M.,Griffith Park/Los Feliz  Los Angeles  CA,4,5,1,12/18/2016,1.0,My first time and most likely my last  food is okay  but service is horrible and it's not even crowded. I arrived at 4pm  it's 6pm and I'm just getting my food
Katy C.,Los Angeles  CA,27,9,3,4/5/2015,5.0,We celebrated my sister's engagement party here last night. It was such an excellent experience! They provided us with a semi-private seating area for our party of 30 and let me go in early to decorate. I have to say from start to finish  the staff was superb. As soon as I got there  the manager greeted me and asked if I needed anything  and introduced me to our main server  Jordan. Jordan was assisted by Steven who went out of his way to make the evening perfect  including finding me tape  placing the finishing decoration on our cake  and helping me with the champagne I brought. Jordan was super professional and really sweet. She made sure everyone was well taken care of.Jordan and Steven were terrific  the manager was especially welcoming  and the food was great. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! A+
Jacqueline A.,Huntington Park  CA,0,4,1,1/21/2017,1.0,Went in with my boyfriend about 3 weeks ago for dinner. We started off with a drink each: he got a Guinness & I the pear cider. We then ordered the calamari to munch on while our pizza was being made. Well  the drinks were the only good thing that night. We only ate about a quarter of the calamari. It tasted stale and old. Not even warm. And each piece was 99% breading than not. Not a big deal so we let it slide without calling it out to the waiter's attention. Granted  we were hungry and were looking forward to our pizza even more now. Pizza gets to the table and it looks great. We each start with a slice and are immediately disgusted. It was cold and all the veggies seemed to be raw! I went in to feel the pizza pan and cold to the touch  were as other BJ's locations  you have to be careful to not burn yourself on that thing! That was the last straw. It only took one bite from our pizza slices for our appetites to be completely ruined! We were unhappy and proceeded to letting the waiter know of our dissatisfaction. He apologized  asked if he could replace the order for us or get us anything else but we were just done and annoyed by then. He took the food away and we asked to still pay for our drinks so we could leave. 5 minutes of sitting there  the manager comes along and also apologizes. We don't blame him nor the waiter. Just serve better food. Edible dishes! Keep your kitchen on check  please!!! After speaking to the manager  we waited another 10 minutes for the drink bill and nothing. So we left! I guess drinks were on the house?! Whatever. Safe to say I'll never be eating here again. I'll stick to the BJ's by my house.... Downey for the win!
Fadi A.,Irvine  CA,0,3,,4/8/2017,1.0,Horrible Experience  took 50 minutes to get the food order in and when we brought it up to one of the managers  she just grabbed the plate with the cold food and walked away  no refills for our drinks in 45 minutes  very poorly managed. Never Again.
Cody R.,Los Angeles  CA,145,4,3,4/24/2016,1.0,"Let me just start this off by saying what wonderful things we had heard about BJ\'s Brewhouse. My boyfriend is a beer connoisseur  and was excited to go to a local brewhouse. We go out frequently  we enjoy divulging in new foods  drink & experiences overall.    That being said  we were extremely disappointed in Burbank\'s BJ\'s Brewhouse. We sat down at an unset table  I am a server/bartender myself so we always are the first to be understanding of other circumstances  busy restaurants  oversat severs etc. so no big deal to begin.    When our waitress did come over  neither of us were quite ready to order but my boyfriend ordered a beer none the less right away  then pressingly asked if we had decided on appetizers or entrees  we had sat down 2 minutes prior - who would have been ready to place drinks  appetizers & entrees at that point?     His beer came and I ordered one for myself and a small appetizer right after. Our appetizer came before my beer did. She asked again when she dropped off my beer if we were ready to order and did not ever ask how the appetizer was. When at that point  no we were still not ready  she seemed annoyed with us. We ordered fried artichokes with a lemon aoli  the artichokes inside were barely cooked and slid right out of the fried battered around it. Again  we were unimpressed and said nothing. She came back and put our orders in. My boyfriend got the Chicken Barbacoa and I got the Chicken Bacon Siracha Mac & Cheese. When our meals came  they looked nothing like the pictures inside the menu or the descriptions that came with it. They were half the size of the portions shown. We never complain so again  we tried our meals encouragingly and were thoroughly disappointed. My entree had no flavor  the bacon was barely cooked  and I kid you not came with three pieces of broccoli. My boyfriends came with one tiny speck of cilantro and no yogurt crema sauce as it had implied.   In the midst of our meals  our waitress came over  asked how the meal was & offered us dessert while we were still eating.. We declined and ""finished"" soon there after. We waited 15 minutes for our server to come back and ask if we were finished. We waited another 10 minutes for her to return with our check.    We go out very often and are always kind and understanding  but this was such a let down for us. We went in on a Sunday  the place was not extremely busy  and no part of our meals were appetizing or what they appeared. Had we not been starving  we wouldn\'t have even eaten half of them.   Overall  I can only give BJ\'s one star  and I do not even think they deserved that. There are so many wonderful places in Burbank  and we will absolutely never be back. Just a headsup to all others who also heard ""amazing"" things about BJ\'s Brewhouse."
Jacqueline R.,Los Angeles  CA,2483,923,2566,10/3/2014,3.0,2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 289/3653.5 stars.I have dined at this BJs twice so far. Pretty decent. Seemed like a smaller location but they still had a good amount of seating. There are a lot of walls/columns so it feels really sectioned off and the layout isn't super open. Thankfully I have never had to wait super long for a table. Service has been pretty good and the food was consistent with other locations. Highly recommend their deep dish pizzas (Great White is my fave!) and their pizookies (large baked cookies with ice cream on top) are a must! I love their Oreo one :)The only reason I was really turned off from this BJs was the valet-only parking. $3.50 to have a guy drive my car into a spot that was literally right in front of the restaurant. I could have done that myself and saved the $$. Valet felt very unnecessary at this location and I was annoyed that I had to pay a guy to move my car 10 ft.
Jen P.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,0,9,1,1/8/2017,1.0,We have been waiting for 45 minutes to get our food  completely unacceptable. Second time it happens at a BJ's. NEVER coming back.
Lorraine M.,West Hollywood  CA,35,17,23,11/3/2014,4.0,I came here for my nephews birthday with my family and we had a really good time. The atmosphere of this place is really fun and the waiter that we had was really sweet and funny. The only thing that is keeping me back from giving 5 stars is that the pizza was good  but I really did expect a lot more from it. The Pizookie samplers were so good!! I will be coming back for those!
Nicole L.,Los Angeles  CA,27,44,,2/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,This is an updated review going from 2 stars to 1 and that's being generous. One of the last times we came to this restaurant there was a super long black hair in my boyfriends salad which was met with zero empathy and I felt like I was begging for a fork. Tonight just further justified my last review. First I was told to input my phone number so I could be texted when my table was ready. We grabbed a drink in the bar and when our friends arrived the host told us they had tried calling us for our table a while ago. Why did I put in my number again? Anyway  the waiter was so absent from the table it was unreal. It was at least 20 minutes between sightings and some of those weren't even for our table. We waited a good 20 minutes for our first round and another 20 for the second. There were no napkins or utensils on the table. We had finished our appetizer and they were finally bringing the food out before I even had the opportunity to ask for them. Then he only brought 2 utensils even though there were 4 of us at the table. If he had been more attentive he probably could have sold 2 more rounds of drinks but we didn't see him often enough. It felt like we had to ration the drinks we did have because who knew when we might get more. The restaurant was busy but I didn't see him serving any other tables until they sat a large party nearby (which he shared with another waiter). Whenever I looked around he was nowhere in sight. Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant if not the worst. The only reason I keep coming back is because the food is  for the most part  (minus the hair) very good. In the future we will try to meet at another location even though it will be much further for our friends to drive.
Virian G.,Sunset Strip  CA,100,10,4,9/28/2015,1.0,1/2 a star because our Bartender was attentive.Cleanliness:Restrooms were terrible. I get that it's Sunday and you had a busy turn around. Honestly I saw three hostess. I'm sure one of them could have checked the restroom. The food:We started with Avocado Egg Rolls.They are my favorite and the real reason I went to BJ's last night. The avocado tasted old. Ordered Wings Extra Hot and sure enough they tasted like traditional. Sometimes it happens so we ordered one more app hoping we'd hit a good one.The Calamari was not Crispy but in fact was SOGGY!! We should have said something earlier but we were starving. I did not want to wait for a remake.Last but not least shared the Jambalaya with Angel Hair. The plate had water in it from the pasta which diluted the flavor. I asked for a side of Cajun Spices hoping to make it better but by the time I got it my food was cold. I spoke to a manager ( Tall  Slim  Caucasian  Male  & used to work at The Cheesecake Factory) and clearly he didn't really care. He made us feel as if we were out to get a free meal. When we mentioned how we've been coming to Bjs for years  even though we didn't have a premiere rewards card. (Simply because I don't really care for one) He would continue to justify the reason behind each plate mistake. We also mentioned how we haven't had food all day since we were on a long ride home  he said he hadn't eaten all day either. I never speak up to a manager for this reason and yesterday was the first time I ever spoke to a manager with a complaint. It was a total waste of time. What a failure! I guess in order to be treated better you have to have a premiere rewards card so they know and trust your word.1/2 star for the pizookie.Total price for the 3drinks  Meal & Experience was $70.25 Never Coming Back Again!!
Suzy S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,2,3/30/2016,3.0,I came here with 9 people for a little birthday get-together. We chose to sit outside because it was available right away. The server was super nice but was pretty forgetful when it came to the orders. A couple of us had asked for water with our drinks and she never showed up with the waters. One of us had ordered a Guacamole Deluxe Burger (I think that's the name) and there was no guacamole in the burger. I ordered the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and it was just a plain hamburger. Two people had ordered pasta that wasn't even the correct type. Maybe we had gotten other peoples orders  who knows? We obviously told the server and she didn't fuss or anything and she kept apologizing. Now for the food itself  it was pretty meh. Nothing too special. The burger I had was cooked to my liking but lacked in any sort of flavor. My friends said the same thing about their food. The only thing we all agreed was good was the wings we got as an appetizer. Our drinks were also way too sweet  hence the need for water. We unfortunately didn't get the infamous pizookie because it was getting late and we all just wanted to go home.All in all  this place is pretty average. I've been to other BJ's and they've been really good. I give this place a 3 star rating for the server being an absolute doll even though she was forgetful and the whole atmosphere of this place. The food itself gets a 2 star rating.
Avo B.,Colorado Springs  CO,3,10,4,9/17/2016,2.0,"Came to enjoy a nice dinner with my friends. After waiting a little over 90 minutes for the food  the food tasted horrible. Ribs where dry   even the Pizookie was dry and burnt. If you enjoy spending 3 hours at a restaurant you would Bj""s"
Godfrey W.,Los Angeles  CA,1,31,2,2/28/2016,2.0,Four us decided we wanted the Pizookie  so decided to head here  since we were roaming around the area  the staff was friendly  but I did notice that they didn't ask if we wanted a refill for our drinks. -10 points in service.The Pizookie was all the yums  never having it prior til that day  didn't know what to expect but the other three liked it  so I guess that's a good sign? +20 for dessertsProbably won't be coming back here. There are other places for foods.
Karen F.,Burbank  CA,28,194,4,8/11/2016,4.0,Best Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms (appetizer) they just melt in your mouth! I will absolutely be ordering them when I return. Service is always nice and accommodating.
John N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,2,3/26/2017,2.0,The food here is always good and it's a big and busy place. Our server was accommodating and refilled drinks quickly. Our order  however  took 90 minutes to come out (for a party of 3)  and was cold. Come on a full stomach because you will be starving by the time you get your food.
Anna I.,Los Angeles  CA,505,211,1261,11/3/2015,2.0,The only reason I stepped foot into this terrible restaurant is because my friend was craving the pazooki or wtv it's called. The waitress was the rudest person I've ever met. The food was terrible. I would rather eat dried road kill than come here again. Oh  the pazooki was great but it's really not worth coming here.
Ingrid E.,Paramount  CA,52,35,1,7/28/2016,1.0,Not the best Bj's ot there. I went there the other day with my coworker for lunch. We usually go there for the lunch specials  especially the unlimited soup and salad special. The reason why I rated this place one star is we both got the wedge salad and the lettuce was yellow. The lettuce was not fresh at all! When we brought this to our waiter's attention he said that is fresh lettuce. When we asked for the second salad the waiter brought back the center of the lettuce missing since we had requested FRESH lettuce. I cannot say I enjoyed my lunch  because this made me feel sick. I do not think I will be returning to this location anytime soon.
Rebecca S.,Whittier  CA,90,86,41,6/22/2016,3.0,Food is good  but service is lackluster  especially app ordets and take out. 2 employees at front desk see me walk in to the take out desk. No one is there  yet im the one who had to ask them for help in getting someone. I ordered take out on the app at 144 pm  got my food at 220 pm. I still left a tip. Ridiculous! Oh  and it wasn't that busy as i could see 4 or 5 employees hanging around goofing off at front desk. I order here quite often  but the service needs work. I know it's not a 5 star restaurant but Jesus... We are still customers and a quick acknowledgment or even a fake sense of urgency won't kill anyone. The take out girl did seem nice though and offered me water while i waited.... Forever.
Sitrak S.,Glendale  CA,43,12,1,2/18/2017,4.0,the first time I went there was on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend there was a long line but they didn't let us wait too long they let us choose our table & they were so nice with us the waitress was so nice too she came in to couple times to ask us if everything is still ok but she didn't come a lot because she didn't want to annoy us the orders were coming out within 15-20 mins even though we ordered a lot of stuff couple times my girlfriend asked them to take a picture of us & them instead of taking one they were taking more than one so I liked that place & im definitely coming back btw they we ordered their classic steak & it was delicious it was so tender & juicy & their floats are amazing too but the star in my opinion was the bazoki so if you're close by you definitely need to go there
Ernest M.,Los Angeles  CA,619,281,663,1/21/2015,5.0,Shout out to patrick! So being a chain restaurants I don't usually like to go unless it's a birthday party someone is hosting. If I want to generally go and eat the top of the list would not be BJ's. ( Note: i use to come here every night after work when I use to be at macaroni grill and like drop like 1/3 of my tips here and have a great time) I came to meet up with a friend here since a lot of the restaurants close around 8pm. We played catch up and Patrick did a wonderful job. I use to be a waiter so I always notice the little things that they do. (timeliness  attitude  knowledge and all that fun stuff) If he was to be certified as a waiter I would definitely give him a job well done. Food was good  service on point  and even hooked us up with a surprise dish! WE were eternal grateful and we would come back and see him again. Good job Patrick!
Juanita D.,Los Angeles  CA,332,598,564,8/29/2013,3.0,"Lord have mercy  their Happy Hour  ""Snack"" menu & beer flights here hit the spot.I only went to BJs back in the day for pizookies (this was pre 21). Now being way over 21 and a craft beer drinker  I was told that BJ\'s brewed their own beers and had flights. __________________________________________FOOD/SNACKS:// Chicken Wontons - both the Thai & Buffalo are beyond tasty// Mini Bruschetta - yes please! light  refreshing and with a side dipping sauce that will knock your socks off.// Gourmet Mac & Cheese - good  but needed some salt & pepper // Cajun Fries (on their BBQ menu) - salty goodness// Buffalo Wings - definitely have a kick to them  be ready to get messy!// Beignet - holy god.. I was expecting a little old fried donut however this is shareable.... it\'s a huge beignet topped with ice cream  strawberries and whipped cream.BEER:Their best deal on the menu! For around $6-12 bucks you can get a small or large flight set with a variety of their handcrafted beers. I\'ve been impressed by all of the beer samples I\'ve had here.__________________________________________In all honesty  I love to kick back here... enjoy some beer and a table of appetizers. The service is average probably because of how busy this place is. It\'s not a 5-star restaurant so I don\'t expect that. One time there was no toliet paper in the womens restroom which is really incovenient - you regularly have to wave down your waiter. I mean these are things that happen all the time  so I don\'t let it get the best of me. Also  I dislike the ""valet only"" option... why am I paying for valet in Burbank?! Park across the street in the mini lot like I do for free! (dates/times apply)Extensive menu - something for all to enjoy. I try really hard to not focus on the calorie breakdown... If I did I\'d probably NEVER dine here  hah."
David M.,Sunland-Tujunga  CA,82,5,1,3/21/2017,1.0,"Very bad experience today at this location. Arrived at 4pm  waited 5 minutes for waitress to come and take drink order. Waitress brought drinks right away and took our order then proceeded to flirt with a table in the bar which seemed to be her friends from high school  was not surprised. Salad and soup came out a little slow but not horrible. Now is when it gets exciting. The food expeditor brought out our food and gave it to the table across from us. The table accepted the salad which was a BBQ chicken salad but turned away the flat bread pizza. The other table started to chow away at the salad and made comments that this does not seem like what they order and we laughed. About 10 mins later our waitress decides to pull away from her high school friends and comes by our table and asks ""is there anything else I can get you"" ummm yeah what about our meal? She was dumbfounded with a blank stare. She obviously was not paying attention to anything but her high school boy friends. She said she would look into it. We waited another 20 mins with twice asking the pre occupied waitress where are meal is and she only once went back into the kitchen as she was too enthralled with her ""friends"". Finally we ask a different waitress and another waiter to get the manager and nothing for 10 mins  NOTHING. Our waitress walks by and we ask her for the manager and he/she never shows. We get up to leave and I mention to the front desk that we are leaving and to let the manager know since he can\'t be bothered to come talk to us that we are leaving and he can take the salad and soup off of our bill. And now the plot thickens..... As we are waking out the door a young deer in the headlights manager comes up and ask if he can help us. We explained everything to him and he says "" well I just got here at 5pm and have only been here for 9 minutes and proceeds to pull out his smart phone and show me the time  really? REALLY manager Mark? Wow no apology  no solution nothing. I ask him if there was no manager on duty prior to his arrival and he says he didn\'t know. Again  really? After a little more non sense out of the manager we left and to never come back to this location which is the closest to our house. Change of management at this location is in order. Off to California Pizza Kitchen it is.Just read through many of the other reviews and am not surprised that countless other people experienced the same things I did today. ATTENTION BJS CORPORATE LEADERS. You have a serious problem at this location. Time to clean house starting with your GM  assistant mangers and the whole bunch."
May O.,Arcadia  CA,0,5,10,6/12/2016,1.0,"Our family thought it we would give this BJs mostly for convenience of location for our daughter\'s graduation dinner party of 11 people. Our ss what our graduate\'s request. We ordered pizza  sandwiches  pasta. After ordering  we waiting well passed 1 hr before being served COLD pizza and sandwiches arrived. Two orders were still not ready  my lemon chicken (thin piece of chicken breast) and quinoa chicken. Im a diabetic and had to search my purse for sugar because I felt the start of a sugar low. The server Alex kept apologizing and checked kitchen several times. NO ""manager"" came to check our table and orders. He only appeared after I complained about the SLOW kitchen service and he being the manager was not making sure his customers were taken care of. He never offered any bread or something to eat while we waited so long for our food. In hindsight  if we had known it would take so long to get our meals  we should have ordered appetizers. Never did we expect to wait 1 hr 15mins after we put in our orders. He did offer to comp the 2 extra late meals  but this won\'t resolve their internal problems. Our server  Alexandra  was polite and kept apologizing for the slow kitchen. This was on a Thursday night at 8pm. I cannot imagine how chaotic weekends are. I suggest the kitchen be expanded into the 2nd smaller unused bar area to improve service.Only reason there are any stars is to give credit to our server Alex who tried her best under the circumstances of poor management.We will not be returning to this location again. I hope other locations are not like this one"
Oscar C.,Valencia  CA,2,40,20,11/13/2016,1.0,Came to dinner today and from the beginning everything went wrong. Out of the 7 orders 2 were the wrong ones and 1 plate was brought out almost 20 mins later. The food was cold and they were out of several items. The server seemed very stressed and busy. We were never offered refills. For the amount of money we paid we felt we over paid. I don't think we will come back again. We should've gone to Bobs Big Boy!
Steve K.,Los Angeles  CA,141,223,481,6/16/2016,3.0,This location is smaller than I'm used to. Parking is in the structure next to the restaurant and it seemed like there wasn't enough space even with what seemed like limited capacity in the restaurant. The staff is generally nice though.
Lynne N.,Burbank  CA,0,8,,8/4/2015,2.0,"My husband and I have given this place so many tries. ""Maybe the service will be better this time. It\'s been a while."" After trying seven times over several years  we\'ve finally given up.Now  the food is not bad  and the beers are great. But every other BJ\'s I\'ve ever been to is so much better. I get the impression that they\'re just doing the bare minimum. And the service is so bad that you\'ll leave 40 minutes later than you intended  because you couldn\'t get your beer and your food. Go to any other BJ\'s. This is just not worth it."
G S.,Burbank  CA,0,3,,11/26/2016,2.0,I've gone here a bunch of times and ALMOST EVERY TIME it's taken over an hour to get our food. Recently I ordered online and when I showed up  picked it up and took it home - it was all wrong. The funny thing is the label's on the boxes had the correct order - but the f**king food inside was completely off. Furthermore  whenever I approach them about this - it's like they're making it my fault some how. You'd figure with so many screw ups they'd be ready and willing to make it right and give you like a percentage off or something. They really need better management and - from how it appears - a much better kitchen staff. It's a damn shame because I've experienced so much better at difference locations. This one just needs to get it's sh*t together. Big time.
Lala R.,Glendale  CA,378,265,542,7/12/2015,4.0,I like this place because the beer selection is pretty good  the food is usually good  and the service is on point. Most of the time anyway. Last night they sorta messed up with our pager and the seating situation but they corrected it and it ended on a good note. My steak was seasoned aggressively well and my drinks were delicious.
N K.,Tucson  AZ,0,1,,2/25/2017,1.0,Extremely slow service. Requested items never brought to table. Food was good but over 3 hours door to check was too long to make it worth the trip.
Emily H.,GRANADA HILLS  CA,55,5,1,5/28/2016,3.0,We love the pizza here but the service is slower than a turtle running a race in peanut butter! Our waitress was not very friendly and hard to get ahold of. The best part of coming here is their infamous pizzokie. My personal favorite is the Oreo pizzokie  it's a dessert lover's dream!
Jay Y.,Los Angeles  CA,1,2,,6/30/2015,1.0,Don't ever come here after 10pm. Service was very very poor...took 45minutes to get two orders of chicken wings  pitcher of beer  and a desert.Never coming here again...
Jeremy W.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,,11/7/2016,1.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'s multiple times and I have never had this kind of experience. I had a decent party with me and it wasn\'t super busy. We ordered our food around 7:50-8 and didn\'t start seeing things until about 8:45-9. Prior to receiving the food  I requested a manager and that took an additional 10-15 minutes. I told him what was going on and instead of him trying to solve the issue  he apologized with a very nonchalant attitude. He later brought out food that was eventually sent back because it was too cold. Our waiter was not really seen until it was time for the ""check.."""
Doug K.,Phoenix  AZ,0,17,2,8/3/2016,3.0,We where excited to find the right by the Hotel. I love BJs. In all the others we are in and out in about 1 hour. Here we were stuck for a 2 hour tour. I don't know if it was the wait staff or the kitchen. Food was not as hot as usual. It was good  but not great like usual. We won't go back to this location.
Alexis A.,Glendale  CA,61,95,22,7/17/2015,1.0,Ugh where shall I start. This is my second awful service at this current bjs location.  First time: Ordered a full rack of ribs. They brought out half. I told the server we order full he said he'll check on it. Then 25 minutes later they bring out the other half. And 5 minutes later someone else brings a full rack and said here is your full rack. No idea what happen there. However that half rack they brought out 25 minutes later we didn't touch because we were ready to leave! Second time: Waited 5 minutes for a someone to approach us for menus. We order drinks and appetizer as soon as she came. Following another 5 minutes we ordered wings it took 40 minutes!!!!! We asked for the check the same time the wings came. Ridiculously slow services waiters and waitresses just standing around when our food was probably just hanging out in their kitchen. I will not return to this location!!!
S. Alicia S.,Burbank  CA,2013,660,3114,8/19/2014,4.0,The USPS in Burbank was so hot inside. I got some stuff  but needed a cool place to write and pack. So I decided to grab lunch at BJ's. The hostess and waiters dealt with my wackiness today. They had really spacious booths. Also  there's a menu just for lunch. How cool is that....I ordered a garden salad with raspberry ice tea. However  I had to order a chicken choice for my salad. The waiter recommended BBQ Chicken. It was so gourmet and fancy. The salad was good.Great ambiance. Good prices. Nice lunch.
Leon D.,SUNLAND  CA,0,41,,7/28/2015,3.0,First one there todayManaged to get order wrongWelcome to Burbank
Ritzi I.,Studio City  CA,201,128,415,5/25/2015,2.0,Came here for my niece's bday dinner. It was during Memorial Day weekend and they werent packed. At all. We got there around 10pm. We were seated right away and our server took our drink orders. Half an hour passed and they barely took our order for appetizers. For that length of time we had already decided what were gonna have as our main course. 2 parties came after us and they have already been served their appetizers while we were still waiting for ours. I called our waiter's attention to ask what was going on. He said its because we ordered steaks and those take a little bit of time. I said  ok thats understandable  but the appetizers shouldnt take that long. Then he said he was gonna check. Couple mins later the Manager (Im assuming she was the Manager) approached us and she was very nice and she apologized and that she saw the time of our order and she didnt know what happened either as to why it took so long  according to her  the appetizers that we ordered shouldnt have taken that long. She was very polite the whole time and I respect that. All in all  we probabaly waited about an hour and 10mins just to be served appetizers. Now the food. The quality of the Calamari rings was wack! It tasted different  it used to be light and crunchy  now its all greasy and chewy and it was a little bland. We had the Gourmet Mac n Cheese and that was good  also the fried artichokes  I didnt like those very much. I ordered the Ribeye steak medium well with the side of filaf rice and chicken tortilla soup. The chicken tortilla soup was a bit salty. My cousin who came later ordered spinach dip and chips. Refer to the picture i posted of the tortilla chips of how greasy they served it to us. Dont they let it sit on a napkin or at least shake of the residual oil? Idk if the regular main cook was off that day or whats going on? By the end of dinner  I got the bill and they waived all our appetizers. They only charged us for the main course and the drinks  which I appreciate  thank you BJ's  but I didnt come to get free food. I am more than willing to pay  obviously  but service sucks. I would understand if they were crazy packed  but they werent. What happened??
Ashley W.,Los Angeles  CA,25,7,,9/22/2015,1.0,Oh that was unfortunate... Though beautiful in appearance the food was in fact awful! The price does NOT match the quality. Our waiter was perpetually MIA.The potatoes were nearly inedible. A paste so thick and dry I could have hung a shelf with it or built a brick wall to last the ages.. The chicken was barely seasoned and poor quality.. Like discount bulk chicken from a bin.. Will not order balsamic glazed chicken again.My husbands burger was basic ordinary nothing great.. just is what it is. The Gluten free pizookie was very burnt and overly sweet. I will try a BJs at a different location and hope for better quality and service.
Sharon H.,Irvine  CA,124,121,100,6/14/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,So our Mother's Day lunch reservations was at 11:30am... Didn't get to order our food until 12:00pm. We were one of the first groups to arrive... Others came after us  got their food and was almost done  before we even got our food. I called and requested to speak with the manager. He name is Ashley. I told her what was going on  she asked if I was here and came over.. 12:47pm our food arrives as Ashley is speaking with me. I told her the service we are receiving is unacceptable... She said a few things and realized whatever she was saying we're sounding like excuses. She was very apologetic and stated they should've been more prepared for the rush due to Mother's Day. I appreciate that she understood that.Ashley  indeed  made things right and accommodated us for the bad service received. Thank you Ashley.A tip for the GM: it's better to be overstaffed than under.
Kay M.,Granada Hills  CA,33,27,,7/17/2016,5.0,This was my first time coming to bjs. My friend and I went straight to the bar section the bartenders there were very nice and helpful.I oredereda mojito which was very refreshing and well made I also ordered the California flat bread pizza which was very good and a good portion to share ..I was very happy with the service
Trisha G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,1,9/2/2015,2.0,Just brought my to go order home and for the third time in a row  the food is terrible! Somehow when I'm there the food is better  but the second I place a to go order its as if they give out the crappy portions that should've been thrown out because by the time you notice  you'll be home and can't do anything about it. I have a new born baby so to get the chance to grab food  even takeout  is a blessing so to only be continuously disappointed is a huge bummer. My crispy fried artichokes were cold and soggy in the middle and the crackers with my ahi poke were so undercooked  I don't even think they were fried at all. It takes a lot for me to take the time to write a review  so please don't take it lightly. Order to go with caution.
Kassy S.,San Fernando  CA,13,53,34,6/8/2015,3.0,The food is amazing and the drinks are good however the service is super slow. By the time my friend got her pasta the rest of us where done with our food we ordered the pizukis and they took forever to come. Our waitress was awesome
Jess D.,La Crescenta  CA,147,216,151,7/14/2015,2.0,Service: ok Food: small cold portions that are tasteless and overpriced
Maria S.,Burbank  CA,14,10,1,5/10/2015,2.0,Both the service and food were awful. We also found hair in one of the appetizers.Won't come back again for sure
Kim K.,Burbank  CA,216,546,3135,8/11/2012,2.0,"BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewery = BurbankSo we went to BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse tonight  8/10/12 with reservations that were made earlier in the day for a table top of 10 at 7:30. We were told they only seating available to accommodate that large of a group would be on their outside patio. (Yea.. fun. It was only 109 in Burbank today). But that\'s fine.. the wind was slowly settling in. I was told they had my table and were just cleaning it up and they\'ll be right with us. Approx. 15 min. later  I jokingly went up to the same guy and asked  whatever happened to that table for Kim?? He gave that look of  ""Crap.. where did that go"". After a moment to regain his composure  he had us follow our waitress out to the back patio So the work begins. We all just sat down  no we don\'t know what we want for drinks (there\'s 5 pages of drinks) and no we aren\'t ready to order appetizers (again.. 4 pages min and we hadn\'t even opened the menu OR ordered our drinks!). But thank you. Little chit chatting then spilt glass of water. Oh the table is up in commotion. LOL! Waitress back.. so can I get you drinks. Well  we just had an accident. Um.. No not yet. Thank you. Wait.. could we exchange this table for a stable table? This one\'s wobbly. Eyes roll  kids help. New table in place. Thumbs up!OK.. is everyone ready to order drinks? Yes. Start with the kids (the ones that look like line backers)  work around. Water with lemon. Blonde Beer. Hefenweizen  couple pops. Cool... No appetizers? No No thank you. Oh wait  hello? Um.  Whoo hoo.. Miss?? Waitress comes back  yes? Do you sell potato skins? Yes. Well we would like an order. Yes please. Thank you.So you ready to order dinner. Yes. Finally. Please start with the kids (I think they\'ve become full backs by now). Couple root beer floats  fish & chips  pizzas  burgers  etc.\'Great! Um. could I get a refill of my lemonade. uhh Sure.Food came. Everything seemed to par. Fish and chips were quite nice. Not to oily. LOVE LOVE LOVE the thin cut fries! BONUS!!! Root beer floats were awesome! Pizza.. eeehh. Nothing to write about here. Overall food decent. Can I get anything else? Everyone no no no no... um  yes. Um hello. yooo hooo. It\'s ok. No  what is it you want? WAITRESS!!! Did you want a drink. Yes... Just a beer with my pizza. HELLO MISS... yes? Yes.. she would like a beer with her pizza. Ok. Beer first.  Tick tock tick tock. Ding.. there\'s the pizza. Here\'s some extra root beer for your floats. Cool  thanks. :))Holy crap!!! No one told me don\'t mix the root beer float mix with the soda!! Bwahahahaha!! It was like a mentos and coke explosion!!! Damn it. LOL. We need more napkins!! Next.. is there anything else I could get you? Um yea.. we had another accident.  We need more napkins. Ok 20 napkins later. We\'re good.Are you Gil? Yes. Here. Sets down a mini pazookie with no candle. Walks away.  Wow.. really?? We come here with 9 people to celebrate our friends birthday and our waitress apparently doesn\'t have time to sing or even smile! Hell.. a candle would of been great! We have been here multiple times before to celebrate birthdays and we\'ve always been sung to. Matter of fact the other group outside seemed to have had 2 birthdays sung to them. What are we chop liver??Fast forward to checks. Mine has someone else\'s item. Theirs is missing it. Can you fix it? Waitress (Rachel) states  can you just put the payment in so I can take them. I have like 6 other tables inside. WOW!! So we just settled up with each other and when she came back she decided she would change the bills to the correct bills. Ugh.. ok  no worries. OH WAIT!!! They added on 17% gratuity to the bill. Now mind you  I don\'t mind gratuity being added to groups. Especially when they\'ve gone through the trouble of at least trying to keep our bills separate. But what is really starting to bother me is waitstaff NOT STATING there has been a 17% gratuity added. And then to top it off  they have an additional tip spot to tack on a higher tip if desired and total. Thought about putting a number in there and subtracting it! WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Listen BJ\'s Management.... hire waitstaff that can handle groups or don\'t give them to the groups and then give them 6 other tables inside! Apparently Rachel doesn\'t like that! Also  its just sneaky.. make it policy that if you have added tip  make the server state the fact. It makes for good practice and honesty. Probably the deal breaker for us ever going back.  :(Thanks for letting me share.Here\'s the break down:Food is a 4. (loved the fish & chips. Root beer floats yummy. Pizza\'s ehhh. Service a 2. (rude  slow and overwhelmed) Bathrooms 2 (no tp  trash cans over flowing)Atmosphere 3 (light out on patio  one was broken all together)Staff 2 (unfriendly  especially the ones taking their breaks on the patio on their phone)Parking $3.50. What??"
Marisa S.,Pacoima  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,1/8/2017,1.0,First of all  I ordered a tortilla soup and it was EXTREMELY salty  i then asked the waitress for a clam chowder instead and it was just as bad. I took one bite and left it alone. It took forever  almost an hour  to get the main dishes! Then when my food came it was cold and tasted like microwaved food  i ordered the big appetizer dish that comes with different types of appetizers  my wings were soggy and barely even warm. My mozerella sticks also  the cheese wasn't even melted. I literally took a couple bites of each and lost my appetite  spent money for nothing  worst BJ's I've ever been to
Nima S.,Los Angeles  CA,38,23,7,7/22/2016,1.0,Not too sure what our severs name was  can't remember if the guy even told us or not  but I do remember the crappy service. He did not ONCE smile... How can you work a job where customer face to face time is your highest priority and not even smile  that's no good.. I had ordered the Sriracha Queso Dip and the photo of the appetizer clearly shower chili  that wasn't the case when we received the dish  and that was pretty disappointing.. Ordered the mini deep dish pizza which came out uncut  had a dull butter knife and nothing else so I had to sit there sawing at the thing.. By the end of the check our server came back and delivered the check with absolutely no happy hour prices when we ordered happy hour items  informed the server about it and he said it was weird (like he didn't even care to look at the bill when he printed it out and just wanted a bigger tip  or what?) and he said he was gonna get it sorted out with his floor supervisor. 20 minutes passed by and we finally got the correct check back which was a whopping 50% lower than the original incorrect check  I will not be returning here.
Juan Z.,Los Angeles  CA,10,18,18,6/6/2015,1.0,It took 15 minutes for our server to realize that we were waiting to order. There was a family that came after us that was attended before us. The food was good but he fact that the service was lagging brought this rating to a one star. I decided to give this location a second chance but unfortunately this location aims to disappoint.
Tamir K.,Toronto  Canada,15,14,6,1/16/2016,3.0,Great variety  decent food  very friendly service. Ordered the ribs and though it was a bit slow (crazy busy night  they were delicious. Should really stock wet naps for a restaurant that serves ribs and wings.
A M.,Arleta  CA,65,323,113,4/25/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Came in on Sunday night for late night happy hour with my friends at around 10:01. At around 10:07 we placed our orders; two of us ordered water and one of them ordered mineral/soda water  waiter said they had a bottle only  which was strange  but my friend told them to bring out the bottle with her food. Then we thought about it and wondered why they didn\'t have fountain soda water when they have a fully loaded bar. She asked the waiter why they didn\'t have fountain soda water and he said I thought you wanted mineral water  she replied that she wanted either or  as she originally told him. We placed our order right after. I ordered my favorite buffalo chicken pizza no ranch  my friend ordered a buffalo chicken pizza no ranch no onions and my other friend ordered the BJ\'s special (I believe it is called)pizza. I also placed an order for avocado rolls. We got the avocado rolls like 10 minutes later  awesome  while we wait for our pizzas!  It was around 10:35 when the waiter came out to tell us that they had burnt our pizzas and they were working on getting new ones out....we were already flustered for waiting so long  but whatever at least he came to tell us. We got our pizzas and mine or my friend looked NOTHING like the buffalo chicken pizza (as we order this frequently) it had chicken  bacon  cheddar  and who knows what else..... def not what I ordered  but was not going to ask for a replacement and wait 45 more minutes! I told the waiter that that is not what I had ordered and he swore it was  he said there was nothing else he could do... wtf? ... the the ""buffalo chicken"" pizzas not what we asked for the the BJ special pizza was cold! We were so upset and disappointed! This has never happened here! The waiter told us he spoke the manager and that our meal was comped. We ate what we could as my pizza still had some burnt on it... and left  but before we left we spoke to the manager and he didn\'t seem to be in the know prior to the incident. I hate when you plan on a good meal and it turns out to be a disaster!"
Lee R.,Moorpark  CA,0,15,10,3/22/2017,1.0,I work in the area of this BJ's location and recommended to a co-worked that we eat here  Tuesday 03/21/17. The place was empty....only people there  were in the bar. We both ordered burgers and were brought our drinks. One hour later  our burgers were brought to our table! I mentioned to the server  that I realize it probably was not his fault that our 10 minute items took 5 times longer than they should  to be brought to our table. But I also mentioned that we were on our lunch break and it did not offer us time to enjoy our food. He asked the manager to come over to our table  who literally threw her kitchen staff under the bus. She told us that when it's slow  they get lazy. I mentioned to her that there are several options in the area  Islands  Wood Ranch BBQ  Chipotle  Panera and that we should have gone to one of them. She apologized to us again and said  she hoped that we would give them another chance. She left and we were brought our check and no discount at all!? After a 1 hour wait for a burger  not having time to eat and talking to the manager  no compensation at all.  Just an excuse and request to try again? Why would I? I would rather eat at Taco Bell  than ever eat at this location  at least I would get my food promptly.
Sandra P.,Burbank  CA,0,17,2,3/14/2016,5.0,This restaurant has the best steak i could ever have they are very nice here.great hospitality. People I advise u to come here you will love it.
Lorraine F.,Lynwood  CA,1,31,1,10/20/2015,3.0,Ate at this place on a Sunday for a birthday celebration. The wait was not long at all despite the busy afternoon. The service was just astounding. Our waitress was warm and very cheerful. She made certain our table had everything we needed.Took our order and everything was out in a few minutes. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and added artichokes to the dish. I like that I didn't get hassled for asking for additional veggies in my pasta like Olive Garden. I was really surprised when all he food was brought out at the same time by different staff members. I hadn't had that experience at other chain restaurants so it was quite lovely for all of us to start eating together. I didn't give this place 4 stars because my food didn't taste like much. The presentation was pretty but the taste matters too. Also  the little dishes that are provided for the appetizers were dirty! Only reason I give this place 3 stars is because of the service from our waitress.
Lynn V.,Granada Hills  Los Angeles  CA,36,84,30,3/1/2015,1.0,"The only reason why I went to this location was because it was a coworkers going away dinner. We did a reservation for 18 people and did call two days ahead of time. You would think the management would be decent enough on holding a table for 18 at 6PM. I understand that most chains/restaurants are busy  but what\'s the point of reserving if we\'re going to end up waiting the exact same time as people who just come in? Anyways  our reservation was at 6  but they decided to sit people in that area and they obviously can\'t kick people out of the restaurant (which is understandable)  but when you have a reservation and we warned them we got 18 people. I think those tables should of been saved at least by 5PM. So we pretty much waited for our table for about an hour and a half Yes  an hour and a half to get seated. Let me just name the issues we had at this place in numerical order.1) We got to our table around 7:30. Thank you for the ""complimentary appetizers""  but this doesn\'t sum up to your customer service.2)It took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks.3)We sat at our table staring at each other because we couldn\'t find our waiter and didn\'t take our orders about 30 minutes later.4) Food took about 45 minutes - 1 hour to get to us. The 1 hour entree was done  but given to a different table....and when the entree came  it was made incorrectly. We spoke to a guy in a plaid shirt and all he said was ""okay."" This is my third time at this BJ\'s and I still haven\'t gotten good customer service for the third time. I think I\'m okay not returning to this restaurant."
Julie O.,Burbank  CA,11,156,498,9/19/2014,5.0,always a great experience here at BJ's.... my sis started with the Jeremiah Red which she's a huge fan of I tried the Berry Burst Cider which I really liked very light beer with that sweet berry taste. very fresh for a hot night. Our fun waiter recommended this combo drink The Jeremiah mixed with the Berry Burst.. Oh what a great taste.... Now I'm a fan... I recommend anyone who wants a beer but with that fruity taste in it ask for this combo....got the Ahi Poke very good combo with the beers we had. A great relaxing night. ...
Meredith D.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,1,22,,6/7/2016,1.0,The service here is the worst  particularly for take-out orders. Literally every time I order something to-go  some part of the order is either wrong  or one item has clearly been sitting out a lot longer than the rest  or both. Plus it takes forever every time. The servers seem to understand the order clearly when they take it  but somewhere along the line it goes to hell. I don't know if it's the servers  their ordering system  or the kitchen - probably a combination of all three - but it needs fixing. I'm seriously done with this location.The food is usually good (albeit somewhat inconsistent) which is why I kept coming back  but after this last time round of chasing the right order while the rest of my food gets colder  I've had it.
Big L.,Los Angeles  CA,10,241,397,9/16/2015,4.0,Great happy hr lotta TVs lotta beer. Long wait for happy he chicken wings. Parking structure close by & free is very convenient. Lotta couples no single ppl. Fair prices but I only visit during happy hr. Refuse to pay full for this stuff.
Dejuan L.,Pomona  CA,115,22,10,3/23/2016,1.0,Went here Sunday night with my gf and was unpleased at the bar first they had no Coke for jack and Coke then no red bull for jaeger and red bull then me and my lady got my food sliders and wings and in the lettuce was a fly and instead of getting a new order she just took the burgers off and fries and got us new lettuce come on now what service is that. Won't be going back there
Tiffany A.,Burbank  CA,32,38,151,5/8/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,A little disappointed this visit. I received a promotion to try the new app for 20% off discount. My boyfriend did everything through his phone with the app. When I got to the restaurant I realize the discount never went through and was told nothing could be done because the order was already closed out. They did comp my pazookie but the discount didnt quite add up. I just let it go because they were busy and my mother's day was already not going well. I won't be using the app again and I will need to start checking my receipt.
Robert F.,San Marcos  CA,0,9,,3/10/2016,1.0,For the second time in 4 months the Food has really gone down hill. The fish and chips was the worst ever. My Wife had pizza and that too was just not good. 8pm at night not that busy and food took 45 mins.We just don't plan on returning.
Coco S.,Herriman  UT,3,128,308,3/20/2016,4.0,We ordered take out from this location while staying in Burbank and we were pleasantly surprised that everything still tasted good (even the Pizookie). I especially love their deep dish pizzas and our order was ready pretty fast.
Adrian L.,Los Angeles  CA,49,38,13,4/21/2016,2.0,It's a BJs  they're basically cookie cutter establishments that produce the same vacuum sealed aura as every other one does. Staff is wonderful but it still doesn't have the cleanliness that one my hope for out of something as prepackaged as this. Unless it's going for the edgy urban feel where you might catch a flu with your meal then yes their cleanliness is on point. I just wish for a little more sterile feeling rather than I just wiped the table with a dirty rag and hope you didn't notice vibe.
Jessica S.,Colton  CA,9,256,10,2/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The GM for BJ's contacted me  after seeing my previous review  and sent me a gift card  so I feel better about the whole experience. BJ's food is usually good  so I'm willing to give them another try.
Ed D.,Los Angeles  CA,19,29,33,3/22/2015,1.0,Came here by chance. Service was good. Food was shit. Ordered calamari & BJs deep dish pizza. Drinks were extremely sweet.Calamari was rubbery and greasy. Pizza was way too salty  not enough marinara sauce  under cooked dough & greasy. Will not return. Woke up the next day with a terrible stomach ache.
Daniel L.,Canyon Country  Canyon Country  CA,0,3,,6/10/2017,5.0,"This is a long overdue review and thank you to the staff at this B.J.\'s Restaurant. Back in January 2017 I was trying to plan a last minute surprise birthday dinner for a friend and about 20 guests. I called several ""fancy"" places that were just too expensive for our casual affair  and I tried a few other restaurants in the Burbank area and they just couldn\'t accommodate our party on the date that worked for everyone. I called B.J.s and the manager (I think his name was Mike) said sure no problem. 20 people? No problem. On Saturday night at 7pm during prime dinner rush? Sure no problem. He made a reservation for us  they put together a bunch of tables  and we were able to have a nice fun time at our birthday girl\'s favorite restaurant. I couldn\'t believe how easy it was. This has always been a nice place to get a beer or have a pizza but this was a true example of great customer service."
Emin S.,Glendale  CA,11,77,15,5/23/2016,1.0,The service was great!!!! But omg the food was absolutely horrible  ordered their baby back ribs and a mushroom pizza!!!! The ribs were so salty it was able to eat even half of it when I was starving  and the pizza was extremely soggy and gross!!!!!
Bunny B.,North Hollywood  CA,46,124,2,4/17/2015,2.0,Place has gone downhill. To me  the pizza is super overpriced just for the mere fact of it being  well  pizza. Tried several different pasta dishes  they all sucked. Bland  lifeless and should be sold for $7  NOT $15 or more. The only dish i loved was their Tuscon Chicken Lemon pasta - not on the menu anymore. They serve shameful pastas!Their clam chowder  fries and sandwiches are pretty decent.
Trisha W.,Los Angeles  CA,271,829,554,6/11/2014,4.0,The first time I visited was back in 2004 at the Warner Center location and was a bit indifferent  I mean I thought it was good  but never gave it another chance until now.I came for dinner on a Friday night with some friends and we had a really lovely time. The wait for a table was fifteen minutes  but it felt like 20. We were seated and our orders were taken immediately. Our deep dish pepperoni extreme pizza was divine. It certainly isn't good for you  but it was a really tasty and rich in texture. The pizza was hot and puffy  but crispy on the outside  cheesy and memorable. We had a pint of BJ's Jeremiah Red for 5.50 a piece which I would highly recommend  it was very refreshing and light. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The hosts were ok  one was welcoming and the other was very rude. our bill for four was reasonable considering we ordered a medium pizza $20  a small $15  two beers  an irish root beer  a coke and a pizzukie for dessert our total was $82 after tax and tip. Overall good experience  will definitely come back here for a cheat day ;)
Joshua W.,New York  NY,260,96,68,7/29/2015,4.0,I've never heard of this restaurant until my visit. Reminds me of Houlihan's... In the sense that it's American dining and cuisine. I recommend this place. They have items that will appeal to all pallets. From the health-conscious to meat consuming carnivores. From salads to bison burgers to pizza - they have it all here!
Martin N.,Glendale  CA,0,10,4,4/27/2016,1.0,Apparently you owe them and the workers by asking for service  their service level is bellow 0  and you have to look around for couple of minutes in order to find someone. And God forbid you change your spot 10 feet away just to have a better view of the TV and its other waiters session then good luck to you. Your previous
A T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,,5/11/2016,1.0,Worst slowest service ever 30 minutes waiting on appetizers and salads waiter bringing wrong drinks
Meriaa C.,Burbank  CA,0,7,,5/8/2016,3.0,Definitely go for the beers and pizookies  sometimes we go to eat lunch or dinner. The pizza is usually pretty good.. I have gotten a salad before it wasn't my favorite not one I'd get again. I recently had the calamari and I figured we were getting what the menu showed but try half the amount. I guess you could say I'm not a huge fan of the food but as far as a bar aspect and the perfection of the dessert they are pretty good and the only reason I really go to BJs. Service is always about the same great workers doing their jobs.
Jacky A.,Hawthorne  CA,126,48,5,3/28/2015,1.0,Service was great. Food was disgusting though. Calamari was so greasy and tasteless. California Burger was beyond soggy and fries were like refried. Pizza was salty and burnt. Even my ice tea tasted bitter. It was all gross. Maybe a new cook is needed. That's how bad you're food was.
Bill L.,VALLEY VILLAGE  CA,20,54,33,4/8/2016,4.0,My friend and I had the Ribeye steaks. I had to send mine back to have a new one redone to Mid rare. The server brought it back and it was perfect. The manager came over to apologize  it was unexpected and shows how they care about their customers. The service is good. We wanted to try the salted Carmel Pizookie but didn't have room. Will have to save room next time.
Matthew S.,Holly Ridge  NC,0,20,14,12/17/2015,1.0,Horrible service. Made a reservation that was not honored. When we were finally seated  they tried to put us at a table for 4 when our party was 6 adults and 2 kids. We asked to talk to a manager and he would not honor our request. Horrible customer service. Will never try to eat here again.
Mia P.,Redondo Beach  CA,75,50,31,3/14/2015,3.0,"Let me start off with the fact that ""Im a people watcher"" soooooo i definitely liked the eclectic group of hipsterz  actors/actresses  wanna bees and that comes out to this establishment.Me and the boo came out to get some drinks we stayed a block away at the holiday innI had one of the flat bread pizzas and quite a few drinks  enjoyed it all.I didn\'t like that it took a waiter 15 minutes or more to acknowledge us after us sitting down even if it was to say be right with yahBut other than that we had a great time on a crowded friday evening"
Brandon G.,Burbank  CA,55,2,,1/14/2015,2.0,"If I had to summarize my entire experience  it would be blah.I saw on slickdeals.net that BJ\'s was running a promotion for buy one entree get one free. I saw the yelp reviews were pretty low  so I went in with VERY LOW expectations. I figured I would just have a nice Tuesday night dinner  and it\'ll be pretty middle of the road  but overall decent experience.I walked and get seated. The bar looked great  the actual interior of the restaurant is very nice and fun  lots of tvs  nice art/wall features etc. We\'re seated  my waiter was very nice dude  but when I asked what he recommended  he didn\'t really seem like an expert on the menu. I asked what he liked  he just told me what he saw go out of the kitchen a lot  and he basically just read off the menu the descriptions of dishes etc. So that wasn\'t that reassuring. I ordered one of their pizzas  half BJ\'s special or whatever they call it (it\'s their ""famous"" combination) and half chicken bacon ranch as just something ""out of the box."" My girlfriend ordered seared scallops  so I figured it would be a pretty easy 2 dishes to knock out.I ordered a beer  and it took 10 minutes for it to show up  and it was served in the cold glass  but the beer wasn\'t TOO cold. I\'ve never waited that long for a beer to be poured into a glass  and then it\'s not at a proper temperature? I can deal with the wait if they were slammed  but this is a Tuesday night. There was a decent amount of people in the bar area  but the rest of the restaurant was empty. Also the temperature of the beer is not the servers fault  but more of the brewmaster  bartender  or whoever was in charge of the kegs. Besides the wait and the temperature  the beer was OK  nothing great  but if it was at a colder temperature  it would be much more enjoyable. When we got the food (which came in a reasonable amount of time compared to the beer)  I was immediately disappointed with the quality. My pizza  although advertised as deep dish pizza  was really a pan pizza (with actually pretty thin-for-pan pizza size) absolutely covered in toppings. Every square inch had some sort of pepper  pepperoni  sausage etc. And the toppings were very meh in general  nothing really too fresh  the chunks of tomato\'s on the Bj\'s signature side tasted like they were canned or preserved or something  it just didn\'t taste fresh. The dough was also very doughy (not too crisp) and flavorless. I mean  the pizza wasn\'t terrible to eat or anything  but for $20 price tag its insanely overpriced. It really really reminded me of Pizza Hut quality  except sloppily put together. That\'s right  a phoned in Pizza Hut pizza with a $20 price tag. Yuck.My girlfriends scallops were an absolute joke in terms of size. They were pretty rubbery consistency  and were VERY small and thing  as if they sliced them in half to yield more on the plate. Again  the taste of the scallops weren\'t BAD  but the ingredients and the amount of food were less than average  mediocre at best.Overall  even with the promotion  I would have rather gone somewhere else for dinner that night. I think it\'s complete garbage that those entrees were $20 (for the pizza) and $15 (for the scallops) when you use terrible ingredients  sloppy presentation  which screams to me overall cheap business practices. My service was decent  the waiter was nice and friendly  but he wasn\'t that knowledgeable about the menu  and the beer was very average for a place that supposedly has signature beers. Personally  it offends me for a restaurant to fool people that it\'s more high end eating and cheap out on the execution. I can go down the street and pay half the price and go to places with nice food. There are much better options in downtown Burbank to eat... go to any of those other places. ANY OF THEM. If you want to go to a place similar to BJ\'s but uses good ingredients  go to Gordon Biersch on San Fernando  which has similar prices but MUCH better selection and ingredients (like night and day difference.)"
Sunshine S.,SUN VALLEY  CA,0,26,2,4/1/2016,5.0,Shannon is awesome  so kind  quick and helpful. The food was yummy  especially the new dessert   delicious  highly recommend it. It's sooooo good
Ronald A.,Oceanside  CA,129,75,37,1/20/2015,1.0,"This being a chain restaurant  I would assume the place is pretty consistent with other BJ\'s locations. After eating here  I can see why this particular location has a low rating. The Bad: They messed up our order. I asked for 1/2 medium great white  1/2 BJ\'s favorite. What we received was 1/2 Mediterranean  1/2 Bj\'s favorite. I didn\'t notice until halfway through eating the pizza (since I started with the Bj\'s favorite. I noticed it right away because The mediterranean slice had some peppers and was a little spicy  and i do not like Spice. I asked our server if there was a mistake  and she admitted that the pizza she brought wasn\'t the pizza we ordered (although she entered it correctly). She called the manager  and the manager asked us what happened and in his exact words ""what can we do to fix it?"" I just asked for a small great white pizza  since that was exactly what I was craving. It arrived  and we ate it. At the end  the bill comes  and I noticed we were charged for the small great white. No discount  didn\'t remove the wrong pizza we received. NOTHING. I don\'t really see the point of bringing the manager over. The Good: The food is tasty. When we received our correct order  it was delicious. In short  I don\'t appreciate getting the wrong order and even after admitting it was incorrect  the staff doing nothing to fix it. Before dining here  I didn\'t bother to read reviews because I\'ve always had great experiences in the past with this Chain restaurant. Now  I can see why this place has such a low rating. I will never return to this location and I urge others to do the same until they can get their act together."
Oliver P.,PORTER RANCH  CA,810,20,20,4/14/2016,1.0,Calamari was the worst calamari I've ever had! It was cold and soggy :/ Didn't want to complain because our server was super nice but never ever ever getting it again! Do not get the Calamari!
Pnut E.,Roseburg  OR,0,3,,1/31/2016,1.0,The worst experience ever at a restaurant!!!! Racist ppl who work here are sad!!!!! Will NEVER be back!!!!!
Vicki M.,Santa Clarita  CA,0,17,1,8/16/2016,1.0,We were here 2 days ago for dinner. My great nephew wanted to come for his 18th birthday. There were 7 in our group. We waited a short time to be seated  then we were lead back into a corner booth by a side door and a server station. It was over 100 degrees out and most uncomfortable where we where sat. People kept going in and out of the door  letting the heat in. No air flow back there.  It took awhile for our server to come to our table  were he said he would be right back. He came back and took our drink order  one was wrong. It was corrected. He took our order. About 30 mins later  he brought over a server who he said was relieving him for a break. Another 20 mins later...still no food!!! We called over someone to check on our food. About 10 more mins the food started coming out one by one. It was like our food sat for a long time and was reheated  because the sandwiches had hard crust edges and the ham was hard! The kids pizzas had cheese melted in the plate. My potato wedge fries were burnt to a crisp! Should have taken a picture. They brought out some new ones  but they were taste less. Finally  the last pizza arrived almost 10 mins after the first person was eating.   There was no apology from our server or reason why this happened. We finally had the manager come over and by then I had already told the server to bring me my ticket  cuz I did my meal on a separate check. I had been there way too long and needed to drive a home  which was 30 minutes. I knew the rest of my group wanted to get dessert for the birthday boy  but I had to go. The manager said he could give us a gift card to make up for the poor experience  but since my card had already been ran he could not help me. The rest of the bunch got a $25 card for a bill that was over $90  not including tip. Unfortunately  I will not be going back there  and I was born and raised in Burbank. Bob's Big is always good  but no beer served. Head there if you are looking for fast service and a least you know what to expect!
Stephh F.,Los Angeles  CA,2,23,14,3/25/2016,3.0,Yes most of these reviews are right service is usually always slow  sometimes the waiter/waitress is super nice sometimes they seem like they do not want to be there at all. So service is 2 out of 5 stars just because of the few friendly ones.The food used to be the best I've ever had even in more expensive restaurants. Their cheddar mashed potatoes are always great as well as the grilled asparagus and I can't forget the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. However  I used to absolutely LOVE the rib eye steak. It was never even close to being bad but recently these past couple of months the steak is usually disappointing. Sometimes it's ok but most of the time is dry and flavorless or cooked to well (I ask for medium) and rarely do they make it amazing like before. I've even sent back the steak a couple of times and it would still come back horrible. Food used to be 5 out of 5 stars now it's barely a 2 just because of the delicious side dishes and desert. The beer on the other hand never disappoints  I always get the jerramiah red (something like that) and at first it tasted kinda funky but now I crave it once in a while and would even come here just for the beer. So 4 stars on that.Last is the wait time before being seated  the parking lot is a little weird valet is only 3.50 but most of the time unnecessary. And what a lot of people don't know is that you can call in to be put in the wait list as long as you get there within 30 minutes. I usually do that and get seated within 10 minutes of going in or sometimes right away. Plus the girls in the front desk are usually very friendly. So 5 stars to that.
Luis M.,Agoura Hills  CA,17,3,,4/22/2016,5.0,Claudia is the best part of BJ's. She makes my experience that much better. Nothing beets the awesome pizookies they serve. A definite must have for deserts.
Ryan B.,Burbank  CA,51,36,7,4/5/2016,5.0,I LOVE that new hostess Chloe I think her name was? So accommodating and such a beautiful and sweet young lady :)
Andrew L.,Santa Clarita  CA,1096,178,145,1/26/2015,1.0,This BJs use to be my favorite. The place is definitely not managed like it use to. Food came out cold and waitress rarely came by. Will not be returning even if food was free.
Patrick D.,West Hollywood  CA,67,4,1,3/28/2015,4.0,My friend and I arrived to BJ's last week    Our host showed us the table  explained the menus and hoped we had a great experience. Waited for our server for about 15 minutes as she walked passed up a few times. Got us waters and asked if we were ready  I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and must I say  it was delicious. Minutes later we also order french fries and those were just as good as the dip if not better.She came back multiple times but my friend and i were just having conversation we forgot all about the food until our stomachs rumbled and we were immediately ready to eat. Our server came back  and we ordered a deep dish pizza. Overall  it was good but our service from our waitress was not so good. I love the overall vibe of the restaurant  management is great and bathrooms are fairly clean. The restaurant has a great feel to it and portions of food are great! The kids would love it here too!
Edward P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,10/30/2016,1.0,Horrible service and burnt food! We drove up and there was a long line of cars for the valet who were so slow that the line went out into the street. We got inside and were told that we'd have to wait 15 minutes even though there were only two couples ahead of us and 25 open tables! We ordered hors d'ourves and fish for entrees which both seemed to take forever. Then the fish was nearly brunt for one meal and just over cooked on one side on the other meal. It was not even that crowded. We will never come here again!
Nicole U.,Sherman Oaks  Los Angeles  CA,192,685,219,1/22/2014,3.0,There was a slight mix up with my buffalo wings...traditional usually means bone in and not breaded. I ended up with boneless and breaded. They fixed it as quickly as they could and the finished product was tasty. Not too saucy and served with a huge side of blue cheese for a dipping sauce. I also had a side cesear salad which was fresh and crispy. Perfect keto (low carb) lunch.Friendly service.Parking can be a pain but we opted to park across the street and walk over.
Vardan T.,VALLEY VILLAGE  CA,115,27,7,10/25/2014,1.0,We decided to go to bj's tonight and we had the worst experience ever. The waiter acvidently dropped a cup and it shattered cutting my wife's finger very deep. The waiter went to get his manager  which showed up 5 min later. Everyone was staring at us while my wife's finger was gushing blood. The waiter had an accident we understand. But the fact that the manager was not concerned about my wife's well being was just wrong. People from other tables were helping us with napkins. Never mind that we still had to pay for our dinner that we didn't eat is just amazing. I hope the manager looks really good on paper in front of corporate with his $50 profit.
Courtney L.,Encino  Los Angeles  CA,36,15,9,7/28/2016,1.0,"I went last night for a friend\'s birthday dinner. Our waiter was Brett G. We were a party of 10 people. I\'ve never in my life had such horrible service at any restaurant  like I did last night. I was disrespected as a customer and I will never come back here. After being seated  15mins go by to order drinks. He messed up our drink order  with no apology. After that  another 15-20 mins to get an order for appetizers. Another 20min goes by  we want to order our meals  hes nowhere. Up to this point  he never checked on us to see how we\'re doing or for refills on drinks. We finally order our meals  my boyfriend ordered a Medium bbq chicken pizza. When food was brought out  a ""mini"" bbq chicken pizza was brought out. No apology  & he went to get a new pizza. Everyone else finished eating before his pizza was brought out. The pizza came out all doughy with barely any toppings. I called his attention for a box  and with attitude he brought one. I also said our service was really bad. We all needed refills and he never asked the entire table. He defended himself and said  ""I did ask everyone  you just weren\'t paying attention"". He was very rude the entire time we were there. Being extremely busy as a waiter is understandable  but there\'s absolutely no excuse for his rude behavior to a customer. I did ask another waitress if I can talk to a manager  but no one ever came. This type of experience needs to be addressed to the waiter himself and all staff. If you are short staffed  I get it  but at least let us know before you start our orders so we would be aware. But don\'t ignore us the whole time. I will never go back to this BJs."
Shane L.,Bristow  VA,159,64,31,5/24/2015,3.0,Service was my favorite! The food was good for having such a large menu. I had the California Burger with wedge fries and their home-brewed cream soda (highly recommended) and the peanut butter s'mores pazooki to finish for desert!Our server was very accommodating and sweet and the environment was very welcoming as well!
Elaine P.,Toluca Terrace  CA,1,29,116,1/30/2015,3.0,Service was so slooow.. Food was good though..
Marivic S.,Simi Valley  CA,13,24,,1/8/2016,3.0,I'm a Burbank resident and don't usually come here as I like to support smaller independent restaurants. My boyfriend and I went here tonight to try it out. The pizza was good  service was ok but felt like we were being rushed out the door. Don't know if I want to come back.
Lee S.,Mountain View  CA,10,43,10,12/31/2015,3.0,Phone ordered and they forgot half my order. I'm waiting for 30m and they didn't even start it. Didn't bother to refund me. Also they screwed up my other order  meanwhile the rest of my meal is in their hot box getting old. A huge line of people for takeout built up behind me because none of their employees bothered to as what the heck was going on. I came in the next day to complain and instead of refunding me  which I wanted  they gave me a gift certificate  so I had to come back. Ugh.The manager of this place needs to get a clue and get fired.However  the food we ordered from the yelp menu (which is an outdated menu but they made it anyway) was actually really good. Not sure why they eliminated both the items we ordered from that menu.
Matt B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,19,17,1/4/2016,1.0,Bj's could care less about it's customers. Both the management at this location  as well as their corporate customer service  have been on par with the abysmal service that you get from Time Warner Cable. Absolutely horrible service top to bottom.
Bobby E.,Glendale  CA,4,35,,11/14/2014,1.0,I just don't know where to start with this BJ's experience. First  if you are considering going here  DON'T! We used the app to dine in and order ahead. We arrived promptly at our pre-selected time. When we walked in  there was another couple waiting at the front. It was obvious they had not even been greeted yet. In the 5 minutes it tool for someone to finally acknowledge either of our existences  two employees stood at the take-out desk and did not say a word or look for anyone to help the people standing there for so long. Several other employee's walked by at that time without even a hello.The hostess finally showed up and could barely finish a sentence  it was bad. So we get our seats  have our server take our drink order (we had ordered the food in the app already). He bring our fries and leave  we had also ordered chili. About 5 minutes later he comes back and asks us if we also ordered soup. We confirmed and 5 minutes later finally got that as well. Did not see him again until we were ready to go. Further  he too seemed to be unable to talk very coherently. My guest and I were quite sure most of the staff had been partaking in some booze on a slow night.Will not be back and could not possibly recommend this location to anyone. Third bad experience in a row and we are DONE!I guess this did not get posted the other day. Shame.
Ben B.,Yucaipa  CA,5,10,,12/8/2015,1.0,I was seated by the hostess on the patio at 6pm. I asked for water to start while I wait for my guest to arrive. It's now 730pm and know one has come to the table. Luckily my guest is running extremely late.
LiLo LiLy K.,Los Angeles  CA,11,4,,9/16/2016,1.0,This is the worst experience i have ever had 1st my pink cadilac tasted flavored water after had to change to just tequila shot then my santa fe shrimp salad came which is suppose to be grilled shrimp the shrimp is not grilled at all this is the worst day i would never recommend anyone coming to Burbank Bjs worst service ever
Tina D.,North Hollywood  CA,27,22,3,4/20/2016,3.0,We've been here before and had nice meals  which is why I am giving three stars. This last Monday  four of us went. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings and schiracha roasted Brussels sprouts. I thought the schiracha roasted Brussels sprouts would be good  but there was only an extremely small amount of the sauce drizzled on. My wings were  without a doubt  pre-frozen and awful. My husband's meal was no better. He ordered the club sandwhich with applewood smoked bacon  and even ordered a side of the bacon. Was not like any we have ever tasted  very thin and undercooked. They only put one strip of bacon on the actual sandwich  just placing it in a an x on the bread. Thank goodness he ordered extra. His fries appeared pre-frozen to me as well. Anyway  disappointed for sure.
Armen G.,Los Angeles  CA,598,280,622,1/15/2014,3.0,Great place to watch a sporting event and have some freshly brewed beers. Food is ok here too I have never had any bad experiences with the food it has always been above expectations.
Deb S.,Los Angeles  CA,11,116,2,1/9/2015,2.0,Came here 2 days before Christmas with my bestfriend. I don't know if it was this particular location  or just our server  but the service was very  very slow. I've been to different BJ locations and they were a lot quicker and attentive.We ordered the cajun pasta with shrimp and the jambalaya.The jambalaya was on point  but the cajun pasta hardly tasted cajun-y and just tasted like a tomato pasta. When we informed our server about this  she brought us dried red pepper flakes (the thing you put on your pizza) after 10 minutes. That didn't help. So we asked for hot sauce (another 5 mins) and barely finished half of the plate.The table next to us complained about their food too  asked to see the manager (which took about 10-15 mins) but I noticed they still had to pay for their food.I don't think I will ever come back to this location. I always get a pizookie (regardless of what my stomach is telling me) but I was discouraged from getting one due to the lack of service.
Natali N.,Glendale  CA,0,5,,1/8/2017,1.0,we waited an hour for our food i had to tell him to bring me Lemons 50 times until he did at the end the food tasted like shit the stakes were really dry and the waiters gave a lot of attitude. he took forever to come and get the check literally 30 min. sticky table. never coming back
Brent G.,Burbank  CA,0,6,3,10/15/2016,1.0,horrible service. greasy pizza  LONG LONG LONG waits and unfriendly check in people. I have been a dozen times and the last few SUCKED. I will NOT GO BACK!! DO NOT GO.
Mike H.,Lake Balboa  Los Angeles  CA,146,303,354,10/23/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"Food is good as usual but the experience this time around was unpleasant. Charlie was our server and we came in for lunch. We were a half hour late even after we asked him to expedite the check for us. It took around 20 minutes to get us our checks "" & change. It didn\'t take that long for us to get our food!!"
Arman M.,Los Angeles  CA,2,21,4,2/26/2016,3.0,The food was alright. I got a broccoli cheddar bread bowl  it lacked flavor. However  some of the other food looked pretty tasty. The beer selection is a bonus. Will give it another try and get dessert next time.
LC M.,Burbank  CA,37,79,147,6/9/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Great place to watch the playoffs AND THE RAIN ( in the flippin middle of June..).. Now if LeBron would just fall down and go boom I would be happy......half time/half happy.Flippin` Nit Wits!!!!!!!
R S.,Los Angeles  CA,417,67,55,7/10/2015,2.0,Beer is great. Coleslaw is the dryest and worst ever and the restrooms... Don't go in there! TP everywhere on the floors & a stink that will make you lose your meal. Good side  BBQ sauce is good.
Lisa H.,Los Angeles  CA,96,69,15,12/8/2014,2.0,"Wished I would\'ve yelped this place before having one of the worst chain food experience.Have been hearing about BJ\'s this and that from a few people so since BWW was packed  we  thy bf and I  decided to make the extra block walk to this place. Again  I really wish I could turn back time to reading yelp reviews on why we should\'ve gone elsewhere.Upon arriving  it was obvious the place was super duper packed seeing people stand around in the lobby area. We get it hence it was a Saturday night. When thy bf and I walked to the counter to check in  the lady w/ the curly hair didn\'t even look up but instead said  ""I\'ll be right w/ you"" typing away at her computer. You can tell she can\'t work well under pressure caz she was short w/ the other hosts. Waited a good 20 mins before getting seated which we didn\'t mind since we were keeping up with our FanDuel line ups. Woohoo for winning that night btw.Our server was pretty average. None of your above and beyond for the extra tip moolah type. Took our orders and left. Pretty much saw her only 5 times; introduction  took our order  called her to give us ranch  gave our bill and took our money. Womp womp.Food was AWEFUL! Here\'s our order:- New Orleans Jambalaya / Worst ever. Thy bf says it tasted like wood haha- Calamari / Should\'ve been called small calamari rings w/ a giant ball of deep fried batter- BJ something burger / MORE no bueno b/c how can anyone do bacon wrong???? These people can! - Strawberry splash / Should be strawberry crap b/c wth WAS that crap? I\'m sorry  $9.50 for that small amount of alcohol w/ whatever strawberry jam stuff and whip is not worth it. Should\'ve just gotten a shot of vodka and call it a day.- Some BJ specialty beerTotal of $56 bad food. Save the money and go to any other restaurant chain."
d p.,Redondo Beach  CA,130,14,,10/8/2016,1.0,my first time will be my last time. my friend and I called in a take out order for a burger and a flatbread sandwich. they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.. so we get there 15 minutes and my friend waits outside blocking part of the parking lot because he has a trailer attached to his vehicle.I went in to pay and pick up the order but my order wasn't ready yet. the guy who i paid said it would be 10-15 minutes.. I told him we already ordered it on the phone 15 minutes ago and they had said 15 minutes on the phone.. he said he was going to check on it and never returned..then I asked a girl who came to the take out counter if she could check and she apologized that their take-out was going slow. I ended up waiting there for 35 minutes.. 50 minutes total from the time I ordered and when I received my order.who takes 50 minutes to serve a burger and a flatbread sandwich? BJ's does!..and even after the wait  my burger was worse than a Carl's JR Six Dollar bacon guacamole burger  yet it costs $5 more  and it took 10x longer to get it...tip to the management  train your employees not to lie about how long the food orders take.. had I known I was going to be waiting for 45 minutes  I could have bought 2 beers at the bar while I waited.. the place looks like it could be a good place to bring friends  have some beers and eat.. but the management is clearly unorganized and the staff is poorly trained.. NEVER AGAIN!
Abigail L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,49,,3/6/2016,2.0,I really enjoyed BJ's the first time we went. The gluten free pizza and pazookie were delicious! On our second visit  the service was really bad. Tonight when we went for a curbside pickup  we waited for 10 minutes after calling them (and after our scheduled pickup time) before I went into the restaurant to track down my order. I'd purchased a pazookie and ice cream because I loved it so much the first time. When I got to the car and opened my order  the pazookie was already cold  and even more disappointing  it wasn't baked. Only the very edges were done  the rest of it was like eating raw cookie dough. Super disappointing.
Vladimir P.,Norfolk  VA,0,2,,9/27/2015,1.0,Last night me and my 3 friends were having dinner. Manager showed up at the table and stated that they will remove all alcoholic beverages from the table. The reason wasn't clear. We were ordering double shots of hard liquor. But we were behaving very well  none of us was drunk  we were very quiet. Basically having good time in a mellow way. To be fair they retuned our money back from removed alcohol. Needless to say  we won't be back to this joint.
Josue A.,WINNETKA  CA,0,4,6,5/30/2015,4.0,Good customer service  good food the lemon thyme chicken was well cooked and the chicken was great in every way also very tender!! But please do not eat the carnitas fries! Greasy and salty!!
Jack H.,Los Angeles  CA,746,490,2366,11/13/2014,4.0,My wife and I go to BJ's once in a while for our date night. They USUALLY a have good food and good service. There is nothing outrageously great or bad about this place. It's a cool spot to go and kick back for dinner. I love their outdoor seating and they've recently changed it which makes it more likable. Service is usually good  except last night. We went and had a server  Maria  that was not very attentive. Our waitresses kept changing which was weird cause one would bring out our food and I was ask for something that wasn't initially brought to us by Maria  and she wouldn't say 'I'll get your waitress for you.  What the heck?! Lol. Like they didn't want to do their jobs or something. Then they brought my wife soup in a bread bowl when my wife didn't want it in a bread bowl. Anyways  other than last nights service  their service is usually good  friendly  happy servers. Food is good and has consistency. It's not like your going to order the same thing and not sure if it's made well or not. If you like a nice place to go and kick back  BJ's would totally be recommended.P.s. I really like their hamburgers!P.s.s. Their pizza's are pretty bomb.P.s.s. DONT YOU DARE LEAVE WITHOUT EATING A PAZOOKIE (unless there is an emergency) lol
Christopher T.,Glendale  CA,0,12,,12/21/2015,2.0,A reasonably atmosphere to watch a sports game  and a fully-rounded drinks menu.The food is way below average. Everyone at my table commented on how bland everything tasted. Dry  unseasoned burgers (both beef and bison)  and steaks that were improperly prepared  lacking all flavor & salt. The sides were all prepared poorly as well  as if they were heated carelessly in a microwave before plating.  Customer service was not very good either  the waiters were not attentive  and the hostesses did not say hello or goodbye  they were too busy chatting with each other.
Douglas H.,Burbank  CA,1,37,1,9/25/2016,3.0,Good food but trying to use the curb side service today I see others parking there and walking across the street to Black Angus. Nice job BJ'S
Cindy D.,Burbank  CA,24,26,46,10/28/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Drinks are good but the margaritas are not strong and are $10.00  for that price i want to have a buzz with just one drink... lol... food is always amazing and great service...
James H. L.,Los Angeles  CA,171,147,32,11/12/2014,3.0,With Elephant Bar closed  BJ's is our local go-to for lunchtime catering when we burn out from burgers and need a wide variety menu. Service has always been excellent wherever seated (and the place is quite big for huge parties  if needed.) Bar area has lots of TV's for sports  if that's your need of the moment. The food is pretty much middle-middle. Nothing really bad  nothing constantly craveable. I seem to like the entree salads the best of the mix  especially their version of the crispy chicken style. Standard pizookies (chocolate chip  peanut butter  caramel) seem best. Their seasonal ones are kind of hit and miss. The Chicago-style pizza never quite has been close  but it's a puffy crust semi-deep dish style that's edibly filling  as long as you're not expecting Giordano's. Fries come both julienne thin and wedge cuts  and are pretty good when topped with the works (chili  cheese  bacon  etc.) or the new Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde version.Have had fun with a Double Deluxe burger - which is best split into 2 open-faced versions since thats about 2/3 of a pound of meat. Not really a date night kind of place  but more like I want more like a Marie Callendar's without pie. Not Claim Jumper or Cheesecake Factory portions  but bigger than average. Vegetarians/Vegans might find it tough here - stuck with salads holding the cheese and bacon bits  or the some of their soups. Beers are plentiful and include the microbrews and a fun sampler flight. Full bar  otherwise. Of course  Biersch  BBG  Black Angus  Barney's  Granville  et.al are up the street  so you could go nuts at happy hours bouncing from bar to bar to bar to bar to bar in downtown Burbank. But for a sit-down-watch-the-game over huge nachos  or bring the whole family for a one-size-fits-all menu - no problem here.The valet parking has to do with the proximity to the big office buildings next door tending to take extra spaces whenever they can get them (none of the 1st street business buildings seem to actually have enough parking for ALL of their tenants). For evenings  you could always walk from across the street from the BofA parking  or any of the multitude of free parking multi-story lots if you're doing a night on the town in Burbank. Lunch hours  I'd stick to the streets along Angeleno  or the lots.
Ryan M.,Orange County  CA,902,905,3324,10/13/2013,2.0,It's very rare that I give One-Star rating to a business  but when a very important person in my life wanted to enjoy dinner with her son and service is lacking  then the low rating is deserved. This is for BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Burbank.Usually  once a week  I take my mother out to dinner to catch up. I had been frequenting the Burbank area more often and I had already gone Barney's Beanery. So  I wanted to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewery. Its located just a couple blocks south of Barney's  but right next door to Black Angus. You have two parking options: Valet or Self-Parking. It will be quite tight at the entrance and exit if you have a pickup truck.My mother and I had come in during a Thursday Night Football Game and ALDS Game. We were seated at third booth from the entrance just at the wall of the bar area. The lady who seated us told us that our server would be right with us. After five minutes  I was wondering where our waiter/waitress was. In about 10-15 minutes  three different parties were seated and their drinks ordered. I flagged down the next waitress that would walk down the aisle. I got a waitress and I told her that this was unacceptable for my mother and I to wait. She said that she didn't know where the waitress for the area was  but she was the only one serving the area. So  that did not make any sense. She had served three other tables  but neglected my table.I continued on to be a customer because my mother wanted to enjoy her meal with me. However  I was already upset by the fact that the other tables were served their drinks and food and it seemed like we just walked in right after. Normally  I would just walk out  but I wanted to see if there were any other pros that would make this up. There was just one.My mother just a lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a BJ's Irish Root Beer ($8.25). The reason why I ordered the BJ's Irish Root Beer was because  she saw a review next to the drink with the name: Ryan M. So I ordered because she spotted it out. Right after ordering our drinks  I told the waitress I am not waiting any more and order right now. I ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer ($16.95) and Crispy Thin Fries ($3.25). I still was quite upset and to tell you the truth  the food didn't calm me down. Best Beginnings was very delicious. Best Beginnings had Spinach & Artichoke Dip with chips  Avocado Egg Rolls  Santa Fe Spring Rolls  and Mozzarella Sticks. Each had their own sauce which can compliment any food. Sometimes  I would dip the french fries in the sauce to mix it up. As I mentioned before  I was still upset and the food did not do the job.The waitress was who did take our orders was going on break. I did get her name  but her replacement  Lidia did better job in a few moments than the previous server. So  its not a one star review  but a two star  just for Lidia. I am not sure if she was aware of the situation before she took over. She complimented my watch and asked for my million dollar autograph when I forgot to sign the check. She deserved the tip because she did her job very well.The incident happened a few days ago and I emailed BJ's Corporate Office for a response. Let's see what happens. I was not particularly fond of what happened  but I couldn't show it to my mother. I know it was a memorable moment for my mom  but for me it was a service nightmare. So  I won't be coming back here until I get a response from BJ's Corporate Office and see how they can correct this service flaw.Yelp! The One Stop Place For Your Everyday Research!
Khatchig H.,Glendale  CA,57,9,1,12/14/2015,5.0,Bj's is one of the best restaurants I've to  their food is the best and their service as well but I don't know for some reason this time that I went it was different. I felt it was 100 times better with the service girl Alyssa she has been the best service provider until now in Bj's probably I'm not going to write about the food  the drinks  and their pizookes because everyone knows how good their menu is.
G M.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,397,710,1/23/2016,5.0,I have been going to BJ's for many years but thank of them as pizza and beer only. But actually we had some great dishes - salmon and quinoa  salads ribs  etc. A great meal and fun place.
Rara S.,San Diego  CA,18,28,,11/22/2015,1.0,Absolutely the worst service ever. Tons of available seats but it seems as if the servers were overwhelmed. There was five girls checking people and tons of people running around but it took over an hour to get food. We went to celebrate a birthday but left frustrated because the service was awful. Good was cold. Salad drenched in dressing and soggy pizza. Gross. Will never return to this location. Anywhere is better than here.
Jennifer N.,Glendale  CA,65,31,5,10/31/2015,2.0,First off  the parking lot is so small you have no choice but to valet for $3.50. They don't accept credit card  only cash and they would like a tip on top of it.We arrived about 8:30pm and it was packed which is typical for any restaurant on a Friday night which is fine. We waited for about 30 minutes and were seated. We got a corner table which was ideal since there was 4 in our party with 2 kids under 5 years old. We were greeted right away by our server and got our drinks rather quickly. It wasn't until we ordered our food  our server had to take a break and we were given a new waitress. That's when our experience went down hill from there. It took 30 minutes for us to get 2 small pizzas  1 pasta order and a kids mac n cheese. The food was cold. We didn't have any silverware. We asked the guy who brought us the food for them  didn't see him again. Had to ask another server for them. We saw our waitress 1 time after that and we had to track her down to order 1 pizookie. That took another 30 minutes for us to get. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes from when we finished everything to ask for 3 to go boxes  wait for those and wait again for the check and had to wait more to get change from the bill. It was just not a great experience. The service was bad  the food was awful and the valet was a rip off. No other restaurant does that in Burbank. The parking structure is so small you have no choice but to use valet. No impressed one bit with this place.
Clarity B.,San Jose  CA,8,57,78,3/31/2015,4.0,Second time here at BJ Brewhouse. I can't say anything bad about it. It's good. Not great. Good American steak chicken pasta pizza. It's the cookies or as they call em pizookies that rock. Tonight we had two f their hand crafted sodas. Super tasty. We had root beer and cream soda. Portions are big. Menu similar to the Cheesecake Factory. Seated quickly. Friendly waitress. I'd return here.
Patrick D.,Glendale  CA,0,30,7,8/15/2016,1.0,Visited this location with 7 other people today.The service was ridiculously bad but the response from the manager in charge in regards to our concern was even worse. First of all it took 40 minutes for our food to come out. Second we had to wait a while for our drink to be refilled. The place was about 2/3 packed so it was not bad and I don't blame the servers since they seemed like they had too much on their plate. When we brought this to the managers attention instead of acknowledging this major issue especially since our receipt had the printed time that we were seated and the time we left  we were told that they plan staffing based on some internal algorithm. I thought the days of giving excuses for your shortfall were over in customer service but I guess not here. Very disappointed with this.
Armen R.,Sunland-Tujunga  CA,112,76,75,1/16/2015,5.0,4 stars for overall food (not counting their amazing 5 star dessert)5 stars for the liquor (thanks for not watering it down like most places)5 stars for our 2 awesome waitresses.#1- Maria was so nice  we had a party of like 9 people and she handled herself very well with all our random diverse orders. #2-(don't know her name) blonde girl with the nose ring  she backed me up when my friends made fun of me for ordering fruit and broccoli for dinner. I love her : ]
Talin M.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,0,4,,9/11/2016,1.0,I have been to this BJ's three times and all three times they treated us terribly. The seating hostess acted like some douche snob towards my grandmother  mother and me. I got the shrimp scampi and they left the breadsticks out. On top of that  our waiter had an attitude  and when I asked for some water with light ice  they acted like it was such a burden for them to get something so simple. Not only that but it took FOREVER for them to get us our food. It took so long we thought they forgot about us and we were thinking about leaving. Terrible BJs  always go to the one in Glendale that one's awesome.
Amy M.,Van Nuys  CA,1,13,2,8/4/2016,5.0,My review is more on the service than the food. Short story is I needed a quiter place to breastfeed my 5 month old. I went to the Hostess desk and a young man told me there was an area of the restaurant that wasn't being seated at that time. He directed me to a little nook at the far side of the restaurant and I was able to feed my baby in peace. Thank you for your immediate assistance!
Robin H.,Los Angeles  CA,9,9,5,11/8/2015,1.0,Waited over an hour for dinner very upset with BJ is I don't recommend this restaurant at all ever! The manager was also very unhelpful. The food was tasteless! I will never go to a BJ's restaurant especially not the one in Burbank again ever! The only good thing about the evening was that they comped our meal for our large party of 15 people.
Lale p.,Burbank  CA,12,101,128,7/14/2014,1.0,Worst experience ever. Hair in my turkey burger they replaced it and I atr half took it home and heated up the other half the next day took a bite and low and behold another hair! What's up in the kitchen? Aside from my hairy turkey burger it took 45 minutes to get our drinks  another hour for my sad excuse of a turkey burger. Not going back again that's for s
Shenny S.,Los Angeles  CA,59,355,189,6/12/2014,3.0,Was here for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Luckily a friend arrived early and was able to grab a table. Overall  a good place to watch a game. Sound was up but not as loud as I'm used to at other sports bars. Waiter service was decent. A couple times the waitress forgot to bring water and napkins when we asked the first time  but second time asking we got it. No biggie since it was a full house because of the game.Parking was tricky. I was lucky to get a spot at the limited self parking lot. There's valet service or you can park elsewhere a block or two away to save money. A Metrolink station is nearby  although I generally don't use Metrolink since trains only arrive only once or twice an hour.Good variety of food and drinks available for Happy Hour including mini deep dish pizza which was decent but not like the deep dish you get at Chicago. I also got the angus sliders. i was expecting something more gourmet than ketchup on the burgers but surprisingly they were good. Guess keeping it simple is the way to go. The berry cider was a bit on the sweet side  but I learned you can mix it with another brew.
Jasmine B.,Glendale  CA,75,10,,9/28/2015,1.0,Wouldn't recommend this certain location  I personally love BJ's but the service here sucks. I went in last night for dinner and ordered a Chicken Alfredo (which if you didn't know is a pretty easy dish) so the server brought the Alfredo without the garlic bread and I asked her if I was going to get it which she said they were making a new batch and that it would be out shortly. It seemed as if the food had sat there for a long time because it was cold. I realized that she had forgotten to bring it since we were waiting a long time. We never saw her again  until it was time to bring the check  she didn't even acknowledge anything. Won't being going to this location anymore. They might want to work on training their staff or at least teaching them common sense.
Michelle R.,Los Angeles  CA,21,5,5,2/28/2015,5.0,I Loooove BJ's!!! My boyfriend and I decided to come to this location because it was the closest to us at that time. The view of the outside of the restaurant is very nice and valet is only $3.50. We walked in and got seated right away. Our Waitress was extremely nice and attentive  she truly earned her tip. We ordered the sirloin steak which was cooked perfectly to our liking. My favorite thing to Order is the Chicken Tortilla Soup  once it came out I was the happiest woman on earth! Needless to say  we always walk out of BJ's with a Completely satisfied Stomach and huge Smile. One of our Favorite Restaurants/Brewery for sure!
Rick S.,Redondo Beach  CA,537,1599,11748,6/10/2013,3.0,BJ's is a reliable chain  the pizza is okay  but the deep dish is not similar to the Chicago styled pizza I've seen replicated at Zachary's in the Bay Area  in that it's more like thick crust than a saucy pie  but if you like a greater ratio of dough/bread than the thinner crust  and like your pizza soft  then you may love the pizza for those properties.I had the Jambalaya which is $15.95 and is a generous portion with sausage  chicken and shrimp and has mild spices  so not too hot (you can add your own hot sauce if you want to too) and is zesty enough to appreciate the flavors without the heat killing the dish  which is what I like.The french fries are thin ('tho they offer wedge versions too) and have the look and taste that makes me think they're fresh cut (as opposed to frozen)  which is always nice.The hamburgers  I believe they cook to order  or at least ask you how you'd like it  which is always nice. It's a decent size too (and comes with fries).The Poke (Ahi/Tuna) dish was good  and has a generous portion of fish with avocado on crisp crackers.The waiting system is buzzer/pager based and the wait isn't that bad when they're crowded. The service is good  and the positions of the TV's are good  so you don't get a neck cramp trying to look at a TV screen  since there are pretty much TV's from every angle  which is nice.It's located in the more busy part of Burbank  near the Media Center area  and they do have a parking lot  either pay $3.50 for Valet  or there's free  but limited (however achievable with the right timing  patience and parking karma) FREE parking in the adjacent structure.
Yess R.,Los Angeles  CA,111,4,,2/21/2016,5.0,I love coming here! It's also my daughters favorite place to eat! Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is delicious!!!
Natalie A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,1/31/2016,1.0,Bad customer service!!! We had been waiting for over 45mins to be seated when a another family (same num of ppl) walks in and only waits 5mins to be seated. Walked out to never come back. There's plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from.
Dave E.,Stevenson Ranch  CA,490,25,1,7/25/2014,1.0,90 minute lunch  food took way too long guys. We have jobs! Food was good but everything about the service was super slow. I even got the wrong order and didn't have time to rectify it bc by the time we got it we had to scarf it down to get back to work.
Mayra S.,Sylmar  CA,1,4,2,1/10/2016,3.0,The place was really nice great service friendly and constantly checking to see if we needed anything but was a very long wait for the food and once we got to desert would have rather gone home then waited that long for the desert.
Luis D.,Los Angeles  CA,333,153,72,11/19/2013,3.0,"You call this ""deep dish""!?Pizza is flavorful but in no way can you call this deep dish. It was very doughy and fluffy. I ordered the cheese and pepperoni and wasn\'t that special. I think that you come to BJ\'s for the bar and the drinks and the big screens and the game and the group and the loudness and all of this is there so you won\'t notice how standard and regular their food really is. Yet you pay the price for all of the other hoopla. One thing that always stand out to me is their sinful delicious pizcookie dessert! Wow! Now that marks the spot. It\'s a chocolate cookie oven baked with a couple of ice cream scoops at the top. Amazing!Too bad for their pizza."
Nancy E.,Northbrook  IL,1,19,10,10/10/2015,5.0,Came for dinner and Tyler was a wonderful server delivering very good food! Such an attentive server he anticipated all of my families needs. I will come back for him if nothing else!
Art H.,Los Angeles  CA,126,25,2,12/7/2014,4.0,Ambiance: I really like the ambiance inside of BJs. It's got nice decor  and is very casual and friendly  although I think I like the one in Glendale more.Appetizers: The avocado rolls are to die for! Also try the calamari if you're feeling it.Entrees: You really can't go wrong with the food. Pastas  Seafood  Burgers  Salads  etc. You're almost sure to find something you like. My friend and I both got burgers and sandwiches  and they came out really good. I was offered the option of thin-cut or wedge fries  I chose thin cut  but they came out with wedges instead. They messed up there  but it was not a big deal cuz I'm not too picky about my food (unless I really don't feel it that day or hate it)Parking: This BJs is ridiculously busy  and the parking can suck. There's a small 2 story lot next to restaurant where you can park for free (if you can find a spot!)  or you can pay valet ($3.50?) to park for you in certain designated spots.Service: Our waitress was really warm and friendly  and attended to us well. No complaints.Overall: 4/5 stars.
Robbie B.,Burbank  CA,1188,343,342,5/6/2014,4.0,Have a whale of a good time at Burbank's BJs. Don't let all the valet signs fool you -- free parking in the adjoining parking lot on the second level!
Felda A.,Glendale  CA,4,5,,7/17/2016,1.0,I like the place  but waiters are a little awkward and unfriendly. They just don't care. My waiter got our food order wrong  he never came back to ask if we needed anything else. Our table wasn't even setup with napkins  forks etc.. I had to ask for some napkins and forks. I just feel like we weren't welcome there
Eric S.,San Fernando  CA,1,15,,6/29/2016,3.0,The last time I went  customer service wasn't so good and I pretty much paid for some fries I didn't even get  but I understand that it was one of their busier nights  considering around graduation times this place gets full at night. Aside from that day  this BJs restaurant always has good customer service  food is good  although I can't find one item in their menu that stands out in particular  everything is pretty good.
Marianna K.,San Mateo  CA,250,375,1806,3/18/2013,4.0,I usually don't wast my time reviewing chains - what's the use? they are all the same  they will not change and... it's a chain! :) I have been to a few BJ's  but the Burbank one is my fav by far. They have a lot of booth seating and tables for large groups. Can't comment on service - depends on who you get - had both great and not-so-good experience. Bar has a lot of seating without the wait  and you find yourself surrounded with TVs playing all different sports. Open late too! Oh  and  in case you have not been to a BJ's restaurant before - pizooooookie is a MUUUUUUUST!
Emily B.,Westwood  Los Angeles  CA,35,32,5,8/12/2014,3.0,Server was scatterbrained!!! Not the best service I've ever had. They have their 2 for $22 deal again  which is why we went in. Always have a goo meal here  yet last night was a little different.Crust was undercooked  and it took a while for the pizza. Manager said he would wt us desert  but desert comes with the deal. Oh well  neither the server or manager seemed to have their stuff together.When the bill came server had charged full price for everything even though we specifically ordered the deal by name. When brought to his attention  gave us some song and dance about how it rings up at every other BJs but at this location the manager has to do it. (Which is all 100% irrelevant to me) had to the wait for manager to take care of it. All in all the worst experience I've had had a BJs which is weird because it is usually just the opposite. Still love their food but will surely not get that server again. Avocado egg rolls were delish as usual. Pizza was undercooked even though it took forever. Pizookie was outstanding! ;-)
Martin D.,Sylmar  CA,37,5,6,11/13/2014,5.0,Love this place!!! Brews are awesome...food is delicious and the service is great. Awesome portions for lunch at a great price.
Everly S.,Burbank  CA,0,4,,1/29/2016,5.0,Went to BJS last night for our daughters birthday. Patrick  our waiter was fantastic . He was very attentive  never needed to ask anything he was already on the way with drinks. Brought the little ones their food first. All and all everything from service to food was great. He interacted with the little ones and we all had a great time.We do come from time to time but tonight was great. Definitely a night to remember. Thanks Patrick!
Amber ..,Saugus  CA,0,33,9,6/25/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I just wanted to update my review because after seeing my last review Nick reached out to me and was willing to fix the issue. Thanks Nick I appreciate it  and I'm sure my next visit will make up for the last one.
Tatiana C.,North Hollywood  CA,56,33,5,10/31/2014,4.0,I came here not too long ago with a Couple friends for happy hour. Love the happy hour. I must of had four strawberry mojitos it was amazing  felt great! Had me turnt up! I had a few appetizers as well. Nothing was disappointing  nice scenery.
Erick R.,Los Angeles  CA,101,419,101,1/14/2013,4.0,"I was out with my girlfriend late Friday night trying to get something to eat in downtown Burbank  when she suggested BJ\'s as we were in the mood for some actual food and not any Fast Food junk. I wasn\'t sure what I was in the mood for  just that my stomach was saying ""Dude  feed me! We have not eaten all day  Bro!""On our drive down I was all like ""Mmm...I smell greasy Cheese Burger. I want me some greasy Cheese Burger. Nom Nom Nom"". This was my first thought as I drove past the In&Out Burger on the way but like I said before neither of us wanted Fast food as we\'ve been having lots of it lately and we wanted to go some place where we could just sit down and enjoy a meal...but at least that smell did help me pick what I wanted. I didn\'t like the Parking lot much  as it\'s really small  and the garage next door was very full. Then again  it was Friday night.Our meal started off with some of the Calamari and dipping sauce. Then to our main dishes which where the Bacon Cheese burger for me  and a patty melt for her. Both with the potato wedges and some dipping sauce.  To drink I had the Cream Soda which was really tasty  and my girlfriend had a few cocktails. The food was good  the service was fast  and the Atmosphere was quiet considering there were a few groups of people inside throughout the restaurant. Our waiter was pretty helpful and stopped by to check on us a few times  and offer some suggestions on appetizers  drinks  and desserts.I think on my next visit though  I\'ll order a Pizza."
Julian G.,Fontana  CA,2,2,2,8/7/2015,4.0,This was my first time at this location so I was super excited especially knowing It was in Burbank & just coming from Six Flags Magic Mountain celebrating my Girlfriends Birthday We decided to stop on the way home and End the night at BJ'S. We were Gretted and seated with respect. At first our first server which was an older lady was kind of rude but I didn't judge she probably had a ruff day and was ready to go home  but our server Torry took over and did an amazing job at tending us. He was on top of his game and I appreciated his hospitality. He even showed us love and took in consideration that it was my Girlfriends Birthday and came out with a pazooki thanks Torry!!! Will definitely come back if I am in the area
William G.,North Hills  CA,40,46,78,12/22/2014,4.0,Love the corn friters with bacon aioli. burger was nice and in house blond ale was refreshing. Thank you for the great customer service!
Mrs. H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,41,4,7/10/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Spoke to GM Matt  he is aware of the service issue and was brought in to address it. After two attempts to reach the manager  Ashley for the gift certificates to make up for the bad birthday dinner ..Matt finally sent me gift cards to apologize. I hope they improve on service it's half the reason families go out. I mean  i can cook pasta and pizza myself!
Colette Y.,Burbank  CA,33,68,27,10/16/2014,4.0,I'm not a fan of the food at bjs but their employees were so kind to my boyfriend and me last night that they deserved this rating. Bjs closes at 12 but at 11:40 my boyfriend and I decided we wanted a pazooki. I had a feeling they wouldn't serve us but right when I asked if they're open they said yes have a seat. I'm sure they didn't want to stay longer to serve us a pazooki but they did and they were super nice about it! My boyfriend also loved the pumpkin pazooki so try it out :)
Matt M.,Chandler  AZ,10,19,13,2/27/2016,1.0,Giving BJ's a 1 star for my most recent visit. I placed an order over the phone last night around 755-8pm for curbside pick up. I asked the girl after I finished my order how long it will take  she responded about 15-20 minutes. I go and get there around 820 and call in to say I'm here for pick up. One of the waiters comes and takes my card and says we are running a bit behind  it will be like 5-7 min longer. I go ok another 5-7 min isn't that bad. He comes back 10 min later with my card and says the kitchen is backed up and it will be another 5-7 min. At this point I am contemplating to just cancel this order because it's 840 at this point and it's taking too long. I decide to wait anyway and until 852 I call in to cancel and they said oh it's on it's way out sorry for the wait. They brought the order and for the wait they gave an extra order of fries. Nice but it literally took 1 hour from order inception to pick up. I might as well dined inside had I known it would be that long. Isn't the purpose for curbside pick up to be less of a wait time? I know there are glitches here and there and kitchens run a bit slower  but I believe 50 minutes is too long for curbside. Believe it or not California pizza kitchen takes 15-20 minutes when you place the order. 1st time with curbside pick up with BJ's and it is the last time.
Narineh A.,Glendale  CA,0,6,,7/16/2015,1.0,Came to eat here with friends and the service was horrible. First of all we ordered appetizers and a salad and had no utensils  asked for it 3 times and at the end the hostess brought it. We ended up eating calamari with our hands and the salad as well. When our food came finally we started looking around to get refills on our drinks. At the end we decide to order desert I must say we have never waited this long at bj's for pazooki's. We were about to just pay for it and leave. Never coming back to this location. Took us 2 1/2 hours to finish this process.
Maddy S.,Bakersfield  CA,0,2,,7/14/2016,4.0,Great experience. Working at a restaurant is hard  and our server  Alec  did a wonderful job. He refilled our glasses  brought me some ranch for my fries when I requested  and made us feel welcome at BJ's. The wait time was only 2 minutes even though they were tremendously busy  props to the table turn around ratio for that one. Only reason I took off a star was because of the ticket time... The kitchen was taking awhile. 30 minutes for 3 dishes? Seems crazy. I know it's hard to plan for the right number of cooks  but it seemed as if we were waiting for awhile. The manager even came by to another one of Alec's table to apologize about their food taking so long (even longer than ours). How can they expect table turn around ratios at a faster rate of the food is taking too long to get out? Anyways  thank you for a great night  BJ's and Alec. If we are in Burbank  we shall visit again.
Mari Q.,Burbank  CA,87,82,12,8/16/2015,2.0,The hosts aren't very good. They quoted us like 20 minutes too long. The server was rude because our table didn't know what they wanted. I don't think he even mentioned his name. And the food was not good. It's way over priced and I feel as though I can make these dishes better myself....
Erin C.,Carson  CA,0,1,,1/6/2017,2.0,great restaurant clean place  nice ambiance however both me and my friend found hair in our food we were so disappointed cause we were so hungry.. Even though our meals were comped it doesn't excuse the fact that this was unacceptable what in the world are those cooks doing back there
Jacqueline E.,Burbank  CA,0,1,,6/5/2016,1.0,Believe me...I love a Poozokie as much as the next person  but as I am currently sitting waiting for my food for 45 min. btw I will probably not be returning to the Burbank location. The waiter is doing her best  but has already lost two tables in the time we have been waiting. I don't believe this is due to anything else  but a lack of good management and not enough staff. Additionally  upper management was not helpful in making the situation better. I do not care how good the food and dessert is  BJs needs to be prepared for a Sunday night rush.
M G.,Burbank  CA,5,119,1,9/28/2015,4.0,Me and my bf decided to have a late night dinner. We were sat at booth within ten minutes. Our server was polite. She could have been a little more attentive. My bf liked his meal and I liked my cherry glazed salmon. Yummm .We then asked for stuffed mushrooms to go. The server returns to say they ran out of mushrooms. Ok this is a huge chain restaurant that obviously needs to keep better track of inventory.I expect better from such a place. I think I'll be back to this location but I took one star off for not having the one appetizer I wanted.
Corey B.,Los Angeles  CA,3,37,66,10/25/2014,4.0,Car pool for this excellent restaurant. Great for groups or families or a date. The valet parking helps for a fee. It may be a bit crowded on the weekends for dinner.
Jim K.,Burbank  CA,0,29,,12/30/2016,1.0,BJ's has a chronic problem with service. I have been in this restaurant numerous times and the service has always been slow but last night it was shambolic. We were a party of nine  got seated almost immediately and the place wasn't particularly busy. The service was typically slow but within the realms of being tolerable. However  when our food eventually arrived  the items that come with fries were served without the fries and our server explained the fries were not ready but would be out shortly. So four of us sat there with half our meal  one of the meals was supposed to be fish AND chips (which didn't come with tartar sauce). The fries did eventually get served. One diner ordered a steak  cooked medium and it was served rare so that had to go back to the kitchen. We waited ages and had to ask our server where the steak was before he fetched it and by that time everyone else had finished eating. There were a lot of other fairly minor things that spoiled the experience but I won't list them. We complained to the manager and she was very apologetic and deducted the four items that came with fries from our check. The food was decent  the server was doing his best but he was new and it wasn't entirely his fault. Management need to figure out why the service is so bad because this place has always had really slow service and it deters me from returning.
Glaizll G.,Los Angeles  CA,269,61,117,6/2/2015,2.0,usual B&Js chain...This review is in regards to their parking. Parking:Self-parking at night is EXTREMELY bad IF you drive a crappy/old car. To self park  you would need to go up a VERY SHORT & VERY STEEP hill/incline just to get to the TOP parking. The incline is VERY SHORT & VERY STEEP that:+ When I drove my SUV up  I was not able to see the top  to see if there is a car backing up or in the way.+ When an older car  tried to go up  it was stuck close to the top and eventually SLID DOWN the incline. (Imagine if you were behind this car. Your car would have been hit... Dangerous  right?)There is valet but why pay when you can park it yourself?
Ruth W.,SYLMAR  CA,9,66,419,10/18/2015,5.0,I absolutely love eating at BJ's!!!! I love the Asian chicken salad. Its the best! The pizzas are good too! They have the best appetizers. Yum! Great place to dine! Highly recommended place to eat !!!!
Rcktmann L.,Southampton  PA,1,36,,4/4/2014,1.0,Stuffed mushroom are one of the best I have had in a long time.The calamari was one of the worst! Way over cooked (brown in color not golden) and had left over onion from a different order mixed in.The place wasn't over whelmed so no excuse!
Jose A.,Studio City  CA,28,152,371,5/27/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Gave this place a second chance   came on a Friday night  yes prime hour but I believe if a restaurant staff can't handle prime hours they should t be open. Service was sub par. We ordered two they both came to the table as though they had been sitting out for 10minutes not hot at ALL !! Barely warm
Danielle G.,Canyon Country  Canyon Country  CA,3,21,8,11/7/2015,2.0,I would no longer recommend BJ's for happy hour. Their happy hour is awful now. $1 off is all you get. They used to have a really good happy hour. I won't be coming back here.
Jay D.,Granada Hills  CA,40,2,,2/9/2014,1.0,"From start to finish my experience at this BJs was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  As I walked in to the restaurant with my family I knew I should have walked out  but I figured I\'d give it a chance. Starting with the hostess  no smile  no welcome was offered  we weren\'t even asked how many in our party. The hostess had the ""I don\'t want to be here"" look. Two other hostesses  one may have been the manager  standing there gossiping with her employees. We were sat down right away which was a plus; however  we had to wait about ten minutes before our waiter took our drink order  by that time we were ready to order our food. If they are going to make you wait that long at least offer a snack. So we placed our orders and as I expected the food took some time to arrive. If you\'ve been to this place you know it\'s a good size restaurant. The main bar was some what busy  the party room/bar was empty  the dining room we sat in did not look completely full so I\'m not sure what could explain the slow and poor service. Our food wait time was about thirty to forty minutes. Our waiter came by once to tell us or food was on the window and they were waiting for runners... Really  WTF  you tell me the waiter can\'t bring us our food. To top it off  the runner tried to deliver our food to the wrong table  we tried to tell him it was ours but he had to go back and check. Let\'s talk about the food  maybe it was the long wait that left a bad taste in my mouth but the food wasn\'t worth the price. I ordered a Deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was good but the pizza looked like it went through spin cycle. Limited toppings  dried up sauce  cold from sitting on the window probably fifteen minutes. The wife ordered a salmon dish. Of course it was cold and the flavor bland... You could smell the curry but couldn\'t taste it. My son had the chicken scampe. This one was OK taste wise a bit cold. Service throughout was nonexistent. Asked waiter for Tabasco and a refill... Took a good seven minutes to get the refill and I never got the sauce.Not sure about this place maybe they had an off day but I doubt it. You can\'t hide poor service. Probably why half the place was empty during lunch hours. If you decide to visit this establishment I hope your experience is much better than mine..."
Greg O.,Mountain View  CA,0,6,,12/2/2014,4.0,I get that this is a chain restaurant and there is nothing super individual about it  but when you are looking for a known quantity there is something to be said for a straight forward place where the food is the same no matter which one you go to. That was my experience here and it was a good one. I sat at the bar to watch MNF and was very happy with the bartenders. Nika poured a great drink and gave me some good recommendations on the happy hour menu. I had wings  a flatbread  and sliders (all small portions on the happy hour menu) and it was just the right amount for the duration of the game (I spaced them out). The flatbread and sliders were what I expected and were good  but the wings were perfect. For the true buffalo wing aficionado  they had just the right amount of sauce and were still crispy. It was pretty busy for a Monday night with the football game on  but the bartenders kept an attentive eye on my glass and were happy to refill it at the earliest opportunity.
Samuel G.,Athens  TN,77,12,1,11/28/2015,5.0,Our waitress and hostess were both very friendly and courteous. Our waitress  Maria  searched far and wide for a hair tie for my date because she didn't want hair in her face when she attacked her bacon cheeseburger....which smelled great by the way. I only had the house Hefeweizen and it was delicious! I tasted her fries and the seasoning was excellent. Great atmosphere  but too many tv's going  but I guess some people like that.
Saul R.,Santa Clarita  CA,12,1,,3/22/2016,1.0,I wish I could give this place negative stars..... I came for my birthday with my family and wait time wasn't too bad but when we got seated it took about an hour before our food came out when it came out all the food was cold.... Not to say the waiter didn't even attend the table properly.... Never going back and would never recommend this place to anyone... Save yourself the time and money don't go here
Ashot Y.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,5/30/2016,1.0,Did not get one of my plates that I ordered because they forgot about it. The fries was cold and super oily. The chicken on the starter plate was disgusting and the chips were cover in oil. The avocado on the avocado rolls turned black the minute they brought it out. Basically the food was horrible!
Aaliyah T.,Burbank  CA,12,12,1,5/20/2015,1.0,Honestly just the worse service I've ever received. I showed up on a Wednesday the place wasn't busy and waited an hour for for our food. It took a half hour for my appetizer to come and to add icing to the cake no one came by and refills on the ice teas. I used to love this place I don't understand what's happened.
Artin Y.,Burbank  CA,3,28,1,10/16/2015,2.0,Horrible service  we waited for 30 minutes for drink..no BS. The pizza was under cooked  their service and food quality has dropped big time the past few years. Maybe its only this location. I complained about the pizza dough being under cooked on their website and received no replies for 3 months now.
Joy L.,Burbank  CA,0,10,1,3/16/2016,2.0,Location #10. Food usually 5. very good...Lemon thyme chicken was fab. ...once u finally get it. BUT SERVICE is appauling. Never offer refill deinks.  Had to flag down every time we wanted something. Finally called the front desk & asked them 2 send him over. We got soup & salad....easy. right? WRONG. We has to ask WHERE our food was after 15 min. And then it was only the salad. another 12 MIN BEFORE the soup cAME out (which  did I mention WE HAD 2 ASK 4.) we have been have been here 5+ times... and it IS ALWAYS THE SAME. NOT AGAIN. ? One and a half hours for lunch after we got there. cookies take 15 min after ordered.
Stephanie B.,Burbank  CA,0,2,,5/25/2015,1.0,Honestly the service was terrible ! The waiter passed us five times without asking us anything when we were done with our meal  the waiter then introduces us to a new waitress. She then threw the box on the table and the check. I've been here several times and I have never had such horrible customer service.
Nancy A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,31,2,9/7/2015,2.0,3 people told me that this place was awesome well not for me and my friends the food is just like any other restaurant the only thing that was very pleasant was the chocolate chip Pazokiee we ate it was yummy. And customer service was good also
Edd-Arlo G.,Los Angeles  CA,128,32,18,9/1/2015,4.0,All my favorite food is served here  I always have a difficult time choosing between the pizza or the chicken crusted Parmesan and ending it with a pazookie  the environment is nice here  the only thing is the parking but other then that good eats
Mary C.,North Hollywood  CA,76,39,17,7/14/2015,4.0,I went to BJ's for a work lunch and ordered a lunch special (Salad & Pizza). Apparently my topping wasn't available but instead of the kitchen telling me  they decided to just give me a cheese pizza. I was a little peeved  my co-worker said something to the server. Our server was Brennan S. and he completely took care of the lack of consideration from the kitchen and apologized even though it was not his fault. The food was good  but the server was excellent and he's deserves 5 stars. Thanks Brennan S!
Hailey Z.,Glendale  CA,290,621,506,3/5/2012,1.0,This place is LOUD! Doesn't matter what time you come here. There is never enough parking and the wait always exceeds an hour. My last visit may be my last. I understand that it was really busy  Friday night  etc. It took my waiter 25 minutes to make his presence at our table. The pictures on the menu of the food are very deceiving (my mozarella and tomato salad was half of what I thought it would be) and the portions are super small  yet the food is so expensive. What I did have here though  was very good. We sat by the bar  which was a huge mistake. This place is where drunk men that are going through midlife crisis' go to to be loud and annoying. I almost put an axe to the chair he was sitting in so he could fall and hopefully hit his head. Not to mention  the stuff he was talking about LOUDLY was quite inappropriate. Had I had kids with me I would have taken it upon myself to tell him to shut the hell up or leave. I really do think that the staff at this place should have taken it upon themselves to ask him to shut up or to leave. None of them said a single word to him. Don't think I'll be visiting this place ever again.
K S.,Los Angeles  CA,71,118,12,7/11/2014,3.0,Pretty decent BJs. The wait was not terribly long and the food is just the normal BJ's food.Make sure to get a pizookie for dessert. Yum
Chandlar D.,Moorpark  CA,0,4,,11/10/2015,5.0,I went to BJs for the first time ever and I personally had a really great experience. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were some of the best shrimp tacos I've ever had & for dessert  I tried the pazooki! Soooo good. It was a Sunday night & it was a bit busy  you can tell that BJs is a favorite place to eat for many people. My server  Alex T was a big part of my wonderful experience at BJs. She was very friendly and outgoing. She often checked to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. She seemed to know the menu really well which is something I appreciated since it was my first time eating there. Overall I had a really great time and I will be back again!
Phil B.,Glendale  CA,64,182,28,1/19/2014,2.0,Had the sweet pig pizza was soggy and under cook also the seared tuna salad lacked flavor the fish was ice cold and tasted fishy  I say Woodland hills or Cerritos this place lacks quality  Our server was great though.
Kaori T.,Burbank  CA,1472,790,1250,2/22/2012,5.0,Dang you OREO PAZOOKIE!!*Shakes Fist*
Mane S.,Lake Balboa  CA,27,462,58,5/21/2014,3.0,We arrived with a party of 8 tonight and the host was very disrespectful she seemed like she didn't want to do her job. Then her manager finally got involved and gave us a table. The food as always was great and our waitress was a sweetheart
Gaya K.,Glendale  CA,3,6,1,9/27/2015,1.0,Used to be good  but now service sucks and kind of depressed stuff! Won't visit this restaurant anymore...
Ellis J.,Los Angeles  CA,243,251,28,5/30/2014,4.0,The parking situation could be alot better....there self parking lot isn't the biggest...so if there aren't any spaces then your forced to do valet...thats whatever...Other than that  this spot is pretty dope. TV's everywhere  big enough inside to where you don't feel too close to others  and service was great as well. I got the brewhouse burger with thin fries and my cousin got the bison burger....both were very good  flavorful  and filling. We also got BJ's PM Porter beer which was a very smooth beer and went well with the meal. I'll def be back for more food  and def the beer. Forgot to take a pic and next time i have to def try the dessert I hear about!
Taylor G.,Simi Valley  CA,0,2,,12/18/2015,1.0,"WORST customer service...made a reservation for 8 people  with 2 high chairs. They tried to fit us in a table that MAYBE could have fit 4 adults. The hostess was beyond rude  the manager had a bad attitude and was rude stating that we didn\'t have a reservation only a ""call ahead"". Last I checked ""calling ahead"" to ""make a reservation"" is the same thing. We will never be attempting the restaurant again. We headed up the street to Gordon Beirsch  they seated us immediately  amazing customer service and even apologized for BJs being so rude. They offered us a complimentary desert to make up for our horrible service at BJs. Honestly don\'t waste your time at BJs  walk up the street to Gordon Beirsch  you won\'t be disappointed."
Vilson S.,Glendale  CA,813,30,188,4/15/2014,5.0,There's nothing like coming to BJ's to get some yummy salads and take in the sports bar atmosphere. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad. I thought the portions of her chicken were appropriate and really loved the thick avocado slices. It was very tasty. Any salad with black beans and I'm there. The lettuce was finely chopped. It reminded me of how California Pizza Kitchen chops their salads. You get plenty of lettuce in addition to the toppings. Our server was attentive and did a great job as the amount of people increased inside the restaurant. If this B.J.'s was near me  I would come here again. Although  I would make mental note of the small amount of self-parking in the area. There is a parking garage for the restaurant  but it also shares spaces with a nearby business. If you get here during the dinner rush  I would probably recommend the valet parking available.
Andy L.,Pacoima  CA,280,220,6,2/17/2014,2.0,Used to come here a lot for the food back in high school and everything was great  would have gave them 4 stars back then. Went back recently for lunch and sever dinners  all pretty lackluster experinces. Food:Same as with any other BJs really. Usually go with a burger or the pulled pork sandwich  if it's a large party we usually grab a couple pizzas and share. Burgers are juicy and delicious  the sandwich is also great  might be my favorite thing there. Pizzas to be honest isn't that good  crust is a little thick and there is very little topping. Toppings arent spread out evenly so someone can have like no crust and lots of topping when someone else ends up with all crust. The beers are tasting  big fan of the Piranha Red. And of course the pizookie  thing is delicious. Keep in mind the party platter is tempting to get but it is rather huge  takes about a good 6-8 people to finish. Service:Here's where the downfall of this particular BJs. Service used to be good and consistent no matter the time or rush. Now the service is poor even when its not crowded. Food takes a while to come out and not everything is brought out at once  some orders are messed up and drinks take awhile to be refilled. And before all that the seating process is a little unorganized. They tell us 15 mins but then after those 15 mins they tell us another 10 and it continues for a few more times. Location:Pretty good location right off the 5 freeway. Also kind of away from the more congested area of Burbank. Once you enter you are met by the valet drivers  you can leave your car to them for a couple bucks or you can drive pass them and find self parking on the second floor of the structure. Be careful of the ramp leading up to the second floor  its a little tight and steep. Also there is not a lot of spaces up top since it's shared with the building next door.
Sarah T.,Burbank  CA,60,38,51,6/1/2014,2.0,We wait a entire 45 minutes to recieve our food. For apitizer I had the spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips  tasted amazing BUT the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was disgusting. The fish was salty and the rice with so sweet. The part of the fish that had soaked up the sauce from the rice tasted like sugar cubes. I couldn't even pretend to like my dish! The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is a great place for game night.
Geoff B.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,45,254,77,1/1/2013,3.0,I've been coming here for several years  with several different groups of friends on different occasions. I would probably say that three (3) stars is probably the best I'd give it. The service isn't bad but isn't good/great at the same time. Whether or not it's busy the workers there are just that; workers...The food is usually good  I can't argue there  but the drinks  mainly the mixed ones are pretty sub par. I would stick to the beers if I felt like having a drink.Regardless  it's a place I'm not deterred from going to  and I will return if invited for a gathering/party.
Alex B.,Glendale  CA,217,95,126,8/6/2014,1.0,I took my girlfriend here at the end of an awesome birthday night I planned for her. All we wanted was a pazookie. So we got seated by the hostess and 10 minutes later the hostess saw that we hadn't been helped so she brought us a menu. Finally  the waiter came and brought us water. He ended up taking our order 10 minutes later so in total it took 30 minutes to order a pazookie on a Wednesday nightWhat was even worse though is that I went to the waiter and I asked him to put a candle on the pazookie for my girlfriend and they even forgot that! I was very disappointed and I usually don't complain but I complained to the manager and he ended up giving me half off of my bill but it definitely did not make up the fact that they forgot the candle! That was the whole point of even going there
Johnny M.,North Hollywood  CA,0,7,,4/21/2016,5.0,Claudia at the bar is the only reason I come to visit and eat. She is the most friendly person in all of downtown Burbank. No other bartender compares to her awesomeness! The food is not bad either. CLAUDIA FOREVER!
Diana L.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,234,77,7,5/17/2014,2.0,Found a hair in my pazookie today.My server kept disappearing.Had to ask a different server for help.I love BJ  but they really let me down today. It wasnt even busy  Ive been here enough times to know that whens its busy  everything takes a lil longer  but tonight. Wow what a disappointment
Carol Z.,Burbank  CA,0,11,,1/24/2016,2.0,"Service is poor  especially the ""hostesses"". Not worth the wait."
Caroline I.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,6,11,,5/20/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The manager of the BJ's got in contact with me  apologized for the bad experience  and offered to pay for our next meal there. I'm glad he took the time to make up for the bad experience.
Susan C.,Bell Gardens  CA,0,1,,5/2/2016,1.0,I am so done with bjs!!! I just left bjs in Burbank  ca found two hairs in less then 2 minutes in our food. All I got from manager was an I am sorry we are all human. I was the bigger person and asked to cancel the rest of my order and chose to pay for drinks and appetizers. But I can't believe that's all I got. When he saw how upset I was he said you can have the food it's going to the trash but honestly I chose not to take it but they just left it on table. Can't believe that is all I was offered. Sad to see the horrible customer service.
Albert G.,Glendale  CA,3,125,603,5/16/2015,3.0,This place is busy and loud. If you have the time and don't mind the loud noise  come on down. The food is mediocre at best. They've got a big menu in order to accommodate just about everyone but their non-specialty items are nothing to write home about. I tried their grilled pork chops and it didn't deserve more than 3 stars. Meat was tough and had no flavor.
Lady M.,Glendale  CA,0,5,,9/23/2014,5.0,I had my family birthday dinner here. The waitresses were very nice  my dad didn't like his first drink and so they took care of it very easily and friendly. They even kept my cake in their refrigerator  then brought it on table after our dinner. They also give a free puzzici with candle when they know it's someone's birthday. Strawberry martini was strong a bit  buy still really good. In non-alcoholic drinks  they have real fresh strawberry lemonade to die for! Overall I had so much fun on my birthday evening with my family. They also had kept my cake box so that we could take it home. Xx
Tania R.,Santa Ana  CA,0,11,16,9/19/2015,2.0,Food is very good but service is pretty terrible. Waiter/waitress seem flustered & not happy to serve. Waiting for periods of 20min in between.
Roy A.,Anaheim  CA,0,1,,9/19/2015,1.0,Worst BJ's I have been too  the food is great but the service sucks. My table was left with out service for 20mins at a a time. The employees seem unhappy and botherd anytime I would ask for a condiment or more water.
Jennie C.,Burbank  CA,37,38,3,1/25/2015,3.0,Bad service today. The waitress and staff were friendly but the chef messed up on my pizza so by the time they made my pizza again my family was done eating. Maybe it was just super busy but this is not the best service from all the times I've been here.
M G.,Burbank  CA,0,2,,9/13/2014,3.0,Its simple....dont have seats outside if your staff wont come outside to call you in to be seated.Also found hair in my salad from a couple of months before. The manager replaced the salad for free. Thats great customer service. But still.Other than that the food is always good. I would come back and recommend.
Allena C.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,7,6,1,6/10/2015,1.0,I came here with my family for pizza and pasta. The pizza was great  but the fettuccine was completely horrible! It tasted like it was frozen pasta that was microwaved. Disgusting! I was not expecting that
Jessica G.,Las Vegas  NV,186,114,161,3/1/2014,2.0,This place doesn't steer you wrong on food  but service here is just awful! I get it if you're busy and trust me I'm not one to complain. But if you can't remember something write it down! Seriously you can't be that smug to not write something down when you don't remember. It's just bad form  and not appreciated  for a staff that large how does service become so terrible? Food is good  but good luck waiting for it.
Erika P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,9/9/2015,4.0,Went for a my mother's celebratory dinner  we had a family of 8 people. The service was okay  a couple of our orders were wrong. A few days later as I was looking at my bank statement and noticed I was overcharged  I called to find out what happened I spoke to a gentlemen who asked me some questions and assured me he would call me back in a couple hours. I never received a call that day so I called back and spoke to a man named Matt  he checked and also said he would call back. Matt actually called me back and noticed that I was overcharged  he gave me two options on how to get my refund. He was very pleasant and attentive  he definitely turned the experience around  he took a problem and made an opportunity. Thanks!
Eric I.,Westlake Village  CA,3,131,99,3/22/2014,1.0,Just ate here and had a terrible experience. The server was great  but the food was terrible. The large deep dish BBQ chicken was cold  dry and undercooked. We also ordered the pazookie figuring you cannot mess that up. Wrong... Served over cooked  too thin and wasn't even round. It was as if someone threw the dough into the pan and didn't care to form it. Never going back.
Jordan S.,Burbank  CA,51,43,3,6/3/2015,3.0,Well  my kids love this place and the food is always pretty good! I had a large party for my sons graduation and the waitress just seemed annoyed the whole time. Maybe she was having a bad day but when a kid walks in wearing a grad gown  it's kind of a special day! I don't think we were particularly annoying   think she forgot to put in our appetizer order. Then asked if we wanted desert and disappeared? We still tipped her well cuz that's how my husband is but truthfully she didn't deserve it.
John E.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,4/21/2016,5.0,See Claudia at the bar. She's great  will take good care of you. Good food  good beer  good place for lunch
Becky W.,San Jose  CA,96,103,562,3/24/2014,5.0,Best bj's I've gone to by far! The service was great and the good sf this location was fresh and delicious! The artichoke dip and artichoke pizza was great. The fish and chips were fabulous as well. Will definitely be returning to this location in the future. I also tried the new salted caramel pazookie and it was AMAZING !!!
Joseph A.,Los Angeles  CA,24,48,16,11/1/2013,2.0,"Boy has this place lost its touch. I used to go to BJs for a long time but haven\'t for a couple of years. I went into this place last night with a group and was expecting the same great service and food but boy was I wrong. The waiter that was taking our order was an excellent waiter with lots of potential but due to the lack of support he wasn\'t able to do his job well. We ordered our food and drinks and it took over 1 hour and a half to get our food because the kitchen was ""backed up"" but the place was not busy at all. When the food came out it seemed like they downgraded in their quality of how they used to make their food. They use minimal of everything from toppings on pizzas to the ranch they give you.Overall I didn\'t enjoy my experience here and will probably never go back into a BJs again. Cheesecake factory has really stepped it up and is doing a lot better than BJs is right now."
Sarina V.,Los Angeles  CA,801,549,1293,12/11/2013,3.0,We came with about 10+ people. Service was pretty good  guy came around but didn't want to really joke around with our big group when we made them. He was a little awkward. Food came out all on time. I had the salmon here for the first time  I was a little hesitant but it was actually good. I was trying to eat healthy unlike the rest of my family who all got pizza's haha. They like their food. My cousin had a steak and fries. The fries were good  I stole a couple. We usually always come to this location when I'm hanging out with cousins and we decide to go out and eat after.
Brooke A.,Garden Grove  CA,0,8,,8/23/2015,5.0,I love the food here its so good ! Service is great I recommend the Mac and cheese and the Parmesan chicken
Andy H.,Burbank  CA,0,1,,3/27/2016,1.0,Haven't been to bjs in a long time went there  worst time ever food was cold server was rude and they are very slow I won't come back again!
Barry W.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,6,10,,10/13/2016,5.0,they have the best unlimited soup and salad lunch. their new rib special has me coming back every thursday
Sabrina M.,North Hills  Los Angeles  CA,90,353,226,3/5/2014,4.0,Good service  good food  the parking sucks. At least 75% of the time you'll be forced to use their valet  and they charge for valet. How about just opening up your valet area to your patrons and losing the valet service?
Rick R.,Glendale  CA,0,6,2,1/25/2015,1.0,Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. 0 stars for service. food was just ok and the wait time is outrageous. Waiters/waitresses dont refill drinks. Dont go here.
Sam V.,Los Angeles  CA,21,20,4,4/18/2015,3.0,"Went to BJ\'s this past Thursday around 6:30pm with a group of 8. They have valet parking outside for $3.50  but had I know I could have parked myself then I would have. They sat us at a nice spacious booth in the corner next to the bar. This was my first time at a BJ\'s so I bought stuff on the menu that had ""BJ\'s"" in the name cause you figure it must be good if they put their name on it. I had the BJ Mojito for $4 which was delicious  then the BJ\'s Oasis Amber which was aight  and for dinner I had the BJ\'s Favorite Pizza for $16 which was just meh. I enjoy a hearty pizza and what I had tasted airy. My buddy told me BJ\'s is know for their pizza  but I didn\'t see what was so special."
Anthony N.,Los Angeles  CA,831,593,2351,6/4/2013,4.0,Have you guys been watching THE CLIENT LIST? With J-Love in it?Don't pretend like you haven't...This can be our dirty secret...just like hers...only mine has melty ice cream involved...although if u watched the show it might not be too long before ours become one and the same.I love BJs..who doesn't? Haterade drinkers that's who. I love their white chocolate macademian nut pizzokie. And I enjoy their hefeinweizen..everything else can wait.I think my fave pizza is the BBQ chicken one. I could huggle that thing all night. Turn on some lifetime with undoubtably j-love in it :)Other than the bad service...which in my head is synonymous with BJs...I still like it.
Cynthia P.,Los Angeles  CA,2,5,,8/10/2015,2.0,Disappointed! My family and I went this past weekend (Sunday) for lunch. We arrived at 11:37am and there were already 2 other parties waiting. I still gave my name and decided to wait ( party of 5). The place was not busy and plenty of tables were available. My family and I waited 20 minutes and asked what the delay was. The hostess stated they were waiting for servers and they were in at noon ( already noon). At 12:08 we were still waiting and so were the other 2 parties that were there when we arrived. At this point I decided to leave and take my business elsewhere. They could have advised us of the wait time. Very disappointed with the poor planning on BJ's part.
Christine D.,Los Angeles  CA,1,3,1,7/2/2015,1.0,Our server was A-MAZING with PERSONALITY! The food SERIOUSLY LACKED in presentation and flavor. Ordered calamari VERY GREASY  potato skins were okay  at BEST. Ordered the watermelon feta salad that looked less than appetizing but tasted good. Grand~spring ordered California Chicken Club...AWFUL! HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!  MY son AND his teenage son  independent of one another said they'd NEVER dawn another BJ's. DO NO  I REPEAT  DO NOT WASTE AN APPETITE AT BJ'S BURBANK!
Stacy P.,Sylmar  CA,7,20,11,11/7/2014,1.0,Hostess are so rude ! I understand that it's so packed (I've worked in the restaurant industry before & know what it's like as a host) but not even a smile or greet from them . . I had to leave ! Customer service is key to a restaurant & this place is defiantly lacking in that area ! Thanks Chelsie for that horrible experience .
Arly D.,San Fernando  CA,1,13,6,6/30/2014,3.0,Parking lot could be better  other then that this place is pretty good. The food is great big portions so there's left overs the service kinda sucks the beer and drinks are good but seating can be a bit cramped needs to expand more the bar is awesome for games though so over all it's ok.
Agnes K.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,17,19,11,4/8/2015,2.0,The Cajun pasta I got was way overcooked  the noodles were so soft & made it taste like it was a day old & was microwaved. Not getting that again that's for sure. The ahi poke app is really good though.
Sandra W.,Burbank  CA,269,211,230,2/15/2014,2.0,Stopped in for lunch here with some coworkers before the thanksgiving break. It's been awhile since I've had food here so I was cool to give it a shot. First off  forced valet. Grr. I hate that. I know it's necessary at times but it's a layer of annoyance that will deter me from coming here. Secondly  food was just ok. I had the Cobb salad (ok  but missing key elements of a Cobb salad  it was more of a hybrid salad) and clam chowder. I took a spoonful of chowder and looked at my spoon- chocolate was embedded on the soup spoon. Gross. Those pizookies are pretty popular I take it  but not mixed in with clam chowder. Took awhile to flag someone down to replace it. My coworkers food all looked fairly ok though. Burger  BBQ platter  chicken pasta dish. Maybe I should have gotten one of those dishes. One of my coworkers is all about their beer  and at the end of our meal found out he could buy a bottle. Our server charged him separately  no problem. However the server then disappeared for about 25 min while we all wondered if he would come back with this bottle of beer. He finally appeared with the bottle of beer  so we could finally leave  with little explanation of why it took so long. There's so many options in downtown Burbank for this kind of food  so I'm bummed that this place couldn't wow me.
Bruce L.,Burbank  CA,0,20,40,2/23/2016,4.0,A nice place  The food is good nothing to get overly excited about but it's tasty and it's not too unreasonable. This location has valet service so you don't have to wait for parking space but self parking is also available
Maria C.,Anaheim  CA,3,4,6,5/10/2015,3.0,"Looking forward to celebrating Mother\'s Day  my family and I ended up here... First  they only have valet parking  but I thought to myself it was sort of nice for a day of celebration. We were seated right away. Our waiter was nice and took our order promptly. I decided to order their BLT salad but with no cheese. I was very clear about the no cheese part and was repeated several times by me and others. Food comes and I get a salad with cheese...lol. OK I\'m a little confused but I understand these things happen so I just alerted the waiters and asked for a new salad. Well  that was a mistake because it came when everyone else had finished eating and me enjoying watching them eat. By this time my niece had also been waiting for syrup for her cold pancakes. I alerted a waiter about this and after she gave me the ""wait a minute"" she came back and said she would tell the supervisor about this issue. Well  I did not have to pay for my salad  which was nice. However  we often had to get up to get the waiter\'s attention whenever we needed something (not the initial waiter who was actually nice)."
Hailey J.,Burbank  CA,13,9,,7/13/2015,5.0,Their pizookies are bombThe reason why I go eat here is pizookies So amazing. All kinds of their pizookies are delicious
Shant D.,Burbank  CA,2,15,,6/6/2015,5.0,Seating is comfortable. Food is awesome. Service is awesome as well. I don't know why anyone would hate this place.
Alexis K.,Los Angeles  CA,3,20,4,5/4/2015,3.0,I used to live in the midwest and sometimes get a craving to eat at a chain restaurant  so we came here tonight. Even by chain restaurant standards  BJ's is only okay. It's loud  but the service was fine. The drinks were good and reasonably priced enough. But the food was generic  and fairly bland. I had shrimp scampi pasta  which was much heavier and less tasty than I'm used to getting elsewhere. My boyfriend got a pizza though  and he was really happy with it.I agree with other reviewers that it's a bit overpriced for the quality. We got dessert  though  and it was the bees knees. A+ in that department. They were also careful about my food allergies  which I always appreciate. So  the experience wasn't bad by any means  but it wasn't amazing  either. Which is kind of what one expects from a chain restaurant  right?
Anish P.,Elk Grove  CA,1,11,3,7/11/2015,4.0,This is a very busy location and parking has to valet because parking is limited. When entering the restaurant I saw many seats open and requested to dine outside. I was surprised that seating took very long when there many seats available outside. The waitress was very friendly and did an outstanding job. The only issue was that it took a little longer to get our meal and desert but I am assuming it was because they were busy. They forgot my daughters meal and try to cover it up but not a big deal. My kids enjoyed the poozkies as usual and my family enjoyed themselves.
Stephen O.,Sunland  CA,13,18,9,1/4/2014,1.0,If I rated this two years ago  I might've gave it around 4 stars. However  lately as many reviewers have experienced  this place has gone downhill. Food and service is pathetic. 4 out of the last 6 times I've been there  at least 1 of the people at my table has not gotten something they ordered. I usually like the BBQ beef sandwich but 2 out of 4 times they come out with the BBQ pulled pork and tell me their computer is messed up. I'm allergic to pork so good thing I know the difference in how they look before I take a bite. That dish also comes with wedge cut fries  which some days you'll get about 8 fries total. It's really pathetic looking even on the small dish it comes along with the sandwich on. My last trip (ever) was last week when my friend didn't get his beer for 35 minutes  and then when my table got all our food they said his was on it's way.... After 20 minutes and the whole table was feeling bad about eating in front of him without his food  we still were basically finished with all our meals when they brought out his burger and fries out. He took one bite of the wedge cut fry and spit it out like something was wrong. He said something wasn't right and we all smelled them and compared them to someone else's and they smelled like burnt hair or burnt plastic. We actually took 2 home in a ziplock bag like CSI in case he got sick. The next morning they smelled fine.Overall this place gets tons of business and is always crowded for big events and yada yada  but their food is awful  and their service is non-existent just like the marinara sauce they were suppose to put on top of my brother's spaghetti.
Candace L.,Los Angeles  CA,2858,1499,3010,3/4/2012,4.0,3.5 STARSBJ's is a great chain restaurant - pop in for a pizza (they now have whole wheat crust  which is wonderful) I love the deep dish with big chunks of tomatoes. Have a beer and order a pazookie and you are good to go! They have a HUGE menu! I'm sure other things taste fine but I go here and keep it simple.This is a very casual place to pop in for a quick bite to eat  good for families and kids. Recently discovered this is one place JBHS Show Choirs go to get their grub on after shows - way to support the local Burbank businesses. Part of me imagined the entire place breaking out in song and dance with all of them there but it's more like them just being teenagers.I like to take my son and his friends here before or after catching a movie at an AMC in Burbank.Parking is a little annoying - not sure what the deal is  sometimes its valet  sometimes its free valet or sometimes there is self parking up top in the back.
Lou E.,Burbank  CA,144,268,80,4/19/2013,3.0,Good people working here. I was given great service. Although the pizza left me thinking why they even call it deep dish when 85% of it is just pizza dough. It's better you go for the hand tossed. The best place for work lunches. It has everything one could want for lunch. The sports games never have the sound on. FYI. No subtitles either but who goes to bars to read anyway? Pizookies are what you want to order. Avocado egg rolls for appetizers are heavy. Just jam packed with calories. The pretzel has just enough salt for it not to be too offensive. BJ's has a foundation for children's learning and health care and are west coast natives. Nice.
Michelle A.,North Hollywood  CA,1,7,3,5/25/2015,1.0,We wanted to go here for lunch  working in a hospitable background you learn to appreciate customer service  I have been to other locations where you were seated right away  offered drinks etc. Not only were we seated to be forgotten about but a whole 25 mins went by and no one  I understand being very busy  short staffed  what have you. But a few feet away and seeing waiters talk amongst themselves and two picking up one table is unacceptable. So we walked out. If I could give it negative stars I would. If you really do want to try out bjs go to another location.
Robin S.,Los Angeles  CA,82,16,9,4/22/2014,5.0,Bjs is really good ! I love the atmosphere there. Definitely go for the pizookies they are to die for! I usually get the chocolate chunk one. The salted caramel is also pretty good. But they have great service Soo worth the money
Julie K.,Burbank  CA,2,6,,10/25/2014,1.0,This BJs is the worst BJs the waiter dropped a cup on our table which broke and cut my sisters finger the blood was gushing out and for 10 minutes we were standing there nobody came to assist us then finally the manager came with a clueless face not knowing what to do. This is the most ridiculous situations I have ever been in. And they actually gave us a check where we had to pay they had only tooken care of my sisters food when it should have been all of ours
Derrick Z.,Los Angeles  CA,52,8,1,5/20/2014,5.0,This place is known for their pizza  but don't let that stop you from ordering from the rest of the menu. Their burgers are awesome and come with perfectly cooked shoe string fries. Last time we were here my girl got the fried chicken with gravy which was amazing but due to a pepper allergy we had to order the fish and chips. Our server Genaro took great care of us and swapped out the order with no issue whatsoever. The beer here is a definite must try. They have a sampler where you pick any four beers on their menu and get 5oz. taster glasses of them... Only $7!!!! Great way to figure out your second round. We're back for the second time this week and had to ask for Genaro again and he remembered us and my girls allergy after serving us only once. If you want a great experience and everything to run smoothly... Ask for Genaro.
Lupita L.,Los Angeles  CA,137,130,1014,2/10/2012,4.0,I don't usually like pan pizza but their's is great. My favorite is the buffalo pizza  chicken with buffalo sauce. Love their homemade root beer  it has accents of vanilla and licorice if you like root beer it's a must try. I also like that they have mini appetizers. Another reason to try BJ's is the Pzookie! Warm fresh out of the oven large cookie served with ice cream!! YUM YUM!They also serve their own beers if you enjoy beer drinking.
Martha F.,Decatur  IL,1,32,,3/13/2016,4.0,Above average food for a reasonable price. Service was good too.
Destiny C.,Glendale  CA,60,251,51,8/30/2013,3.0,I visited this location yesterday with my daughter and the bf. Three things stood out to us; the hostess  our server and our food. Our visit started off and ended poorly with the hostess. She seemed distracted and made us feel unimportant... like  she had better things to do than greet us. There was no one else standing in the waiting area so I'm not sure what she could have possibly been distracted by. Then again  when we left the restaurant she didn't bother acknowledging our presence. She brushed past us... as if she still had something better to do. She wasn't with a guest either time that we encountered her so there really is no excuse for her rudeness and lack of... hosting. Someone yelled across the restaurant to thank us as we were leaving so we weren't the only ones who noticed her complete lack of friendliness. Unfortunately  our pizza was pretty terrible. I am a big fan of BJs pizza and was very disappointed by what we were served. We ordered an appetizer platter  which was absolutely delicious. The pizza  however  did not live up to the same standard. My 2 year old daughter is a huge fan of pizza (as most toddlers are) and she didn't even eat it. The pizza was grossly lacking in sauce and cheese. It tasted as if we were just eating bread. I can get a large pizza for $5 at a pizza chain. When you walk away from a pizza restaurant having spent $50 on 1 pizza and an appetizer  you expect good pizza. I think this is the first time pizza leftovers have survived breakfast in my home. The good news is that I was very impressed with our server. His name was David and he was possibly the best server I have ever encountered. I was a server for 7 years  it would be fair to say that I have high standards and David exceeded every one of my expectations. He was incredibly friendly and attentive from the moment he approached us. I cannot say enough about how impressed we were with the level of service he provided. You can thank him for 3 stars instead of 1 or 2!
Caresse V.,San Diego  CA,72,38,65,1/20/2015,5.0,The PARKING: When you pull in  you have the option to valet for $3.50 or to take your chance at self parking on the top floor of a 2 story parking complex that is right across from the restaurant driveway. The most time I usually spend looking for a spot is a minute  max. The WAIT: Our average wait time is 5 minutes give or take. Sometimes we are seated right away. Bottom line is I have never had to wait past 20 minutes (For 2 of us).The PLACE: The restaurant has a great layout. It's perfect for dates  big groups and game nights.The FOOD: I have ordered so many items from the menu but I'll mention a few that I love and a couple that are...meh.Appetizers - My favorite appetizer is the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. They're mouth watering good. The mushrooms are juicy and the spinach filling is full of savory cheesy goodness. The lemon pesto sauce is a beautiful compliment to the mushrooms. I have to plead with myself not to lick the plate clean  lest I lose my date's interest. lol... My second favorite is the Ahi Poke. The tuna is fresh and the poke sauce is to die for! Lastly  the hot wings. The hot wings are great. They are crispy with a nice light salty batter with sauce on the side. The celery is fresh and the ranch is a good quality. The wings are great to share and pair well with pretty much all of their beer choices.Entrees - My favorite entree has to be the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. The glazed mahi mahi is oven roasted and served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice mixed with a spicy soy ginger sauce then topped with slivered snow peas  red bell peppers and sesame seeds. The fish is always cooked perfectly. The rice mixture is sweet and savory and light. During my last visit I decided to try the Prime Rib (Just under $20). I asked for it to be served medium rare. I ordered it with seasonal veggies and cheese mashed potatoes. When it came out  it was well done  the potatoes were fine but the veggies were under cooked and were 90% sliced carrots  green beans and Asian peas. Normally  I don't care and I will eat whatever they give me. But at $20  I really wanted something I would enjoy so after showing the waitress the steak (she saw the issue right away and offered to get it fixed) I asked her if they could give me rice pilaf instead of the veggies. They were so kind and apologetic about it. After the waitress left with my plate  the manager stopped by and apologized as well. He was really awesome. When it came out  the waitress asked me to check it while she was there  so I cut into it and it was PERFECT. I mean  the steak could be in an educational book to show exactly what medium rare should look like. It tasted  awesome! The taste was something that merits being a $40 steak. It had really good seasoning and was so juicy. The rice pilaf was scrumptious as well. It was cooked perfectly and had a really yummy chicken broth taste. The potatoes (while a bit pasty for my liking) were very tasty as well. Dessert - The Pazookies are a must when you come to BJ's. The cookie is fresh out of the oven and the ice cream is so creamy! I am always too full to get one after a meal  so I will go JUST FOR ONE . If you haven't tried it  you must!In conclusion  there are many awesome dish choices at BJ's  but I love this location for it's fantastic customer service and for their awesome chef. Thank you and Bon Apetit!
Eunice L.,La Crescenta  CA,199,32,8,3/7/2015,3.0,It didn't seem too busy when we came in  but everything was just average.Our waitress was nice  but she was barely around and forgot our drink and ketchup. Another guy brought us our food and it was just decent. We ordered bacon cheeseburger and chicken wings. The Malibu teriyaki glaze on the wings was delicious  but both entrees came out barely warm... like it was sitting out for a while. The fries with the burger tasted like they were just reheated in the microwave. The pazookie at the end was delicious... actually hot.Normally the BJ's chain is great  but this time around was.. mehh...
Mike M.,Sunland  CA,242,378,231,7/22/2013,3.0,I'm not a huge fan of the pizza  but the beef dip sandwich is pretty good. Served on garlic bread and along with shoestring fries  it's surprisingly lower in calories than most of the burgers! Throw in a cold cider and you have a great lunch - if you have the time (service is VERY slow here.)
Erika M.,Los Angeles  CA,413,496,123,7/29/2013,3.0,Our group of 7 came in on a Friday night  celebrating my brother & future sis-in-law. We were seated right away  which was nice. Our server was amazing. Super nice  super attentive  super patient and super accommodating. Super!My qualm with this particular night? The fiancee and I shared their BBQ platter for two. The BBQ platter was sub par. It tasted like the meat had been reheated. We didn't even finish our plate  we were so unsatisfied. Add on to the fact that our platter was the last plate to make it to the table. Waaaay after our group was finishing up their meals. Turns out that our first dish was overcooked  so they had to prepare another one. Yet  we were never notified of the incident until we complained. Our server had left us in the care of another server because he was going on break. This new server blew. When we complained to him  he said he'd bring it up to the manager. The manager came over  apologized and offered a pazookie for our troubles. That's it?! So we complained again. Another manager came and comped us our two appetizers. Now we're talking. Customer service means that you keep your customer happy. If they have to wait until their dinner party finishes eating to get their meal  then you now have a problem. Your next move is to fix it. Simple as that. Thanks to our server and the second manager that came to our table for salvaging what was supposed to be a celebratory night.
Max H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,29,,7/25/2014,2.0,Overpriced average food  ridiculously slow service. Our order was not taken until we had been there for 25 minutes. Then food was delivered another 40 minutes after that. Price for lunch special seems to be a crap shoot and not what's actually in the menu. Had to ask for my Salad three times before actually getting it.On the plus side  they did offer one of the guys in our party a free dessert for his Birthday which was nice of them. That said  too little too late. Will not be returning.If you have an hour and a half to burn during your lunch hour and want to over pay for average food  this place is perfect.
Sevag R.,Downey  CA,0,2,,2/10/2016,5.0,The food was great but the service was even better! Heime is the waiter to have!! He did everything we asked for with no questions asked and no attitude!
Christina A.,Burbank  CA,100,19,14,1/26/2015,4.0,I really enjoy coming here for lunch and dinner. The main thing I order is the sante fe salad because I'm a salad lover. The beer is great and it's a hype environment. The only thing that I would change is their portions. Compared to the glendale locations It's too small not too fulfilling  glendale has bigger portions.. Other than that everything is good. The pazookies are a must im sure everyone knows about those haha.
Julie M.,Burbank  CA,4,78,448,2/15/2015,2.0,I'm giving only 2 stars  and that is being generous. We tried the sliders  chicken wings and mini BJ's Favorite pizza. We rarely saw our server. We she did come by  I told her the pizza was bone dry. No sauce and just a token of cheese. I had to ask for a dish of marinara to cover it in just so I could eat it. No offer to redo it or get me something else. Service was really slow throughout the meal no refills on drinks either. The sliders and wings were good  thus the 2 stars.
Joseph M.,Palmdale  CA,0,3,,2/24/2016,1.0,Went to this BJ's to take my brother out for his birthday. Both our wives were there with us. Service by our waiter was good. Ordered calamari appetizer and was barely enough for two people and when our dinner came out everything was cold. Kitchen made the food and the servers forgot to bring it out until the Pizza was cold and had to be reheated. My wife had the Black and Bleu-House burger was cold and missing the bacon and bleu cheese. My Roast beef dip was barely warm and fries were the same. Will never go back to this BJ's again and sounds like the reviews I'm reading  not many more people will either. Finally I sent an email to BJ's Corporate email and no response at all so seems like they don't care at all either. Bye bye BJ's...........
Amanda H.,Los Angeles  CA,6,9,,11/11/2014,4.0,Great place except they no longer serve the stuffed potato for dinner!!=(
Marvyn R.,Los Angeles  CA,2,2,,2/23/2014,1.0,Number 1. They didn't have a server at our table for 15mins. 2 servers asked us later throughout the night if we had one. FAIL! Next ... After two drinks they denied us of drinks on my best friends birthdays. We kindly asked the manager to come out but no success. In conclusions  don't come here on birthdays
Rob L.,San Diego  CA,40,102,17,11/27/2013,3.0,Cold cheap beer = good. Cold cheap food = not so much. We came for the late night happy hour which was from 10pm-close. Seated ourselves at a hi-top in the bar area. Our server was fast and attentive. Very nice. The drinks were cheap  $4 for a pint  $5 for a house martini. My fianc ordered the boneless wings  I had the mini deep dish pizza. Her wings looked like chicken mcnuggets dipped in wing sauce. (How they tasted also). And I've definitely had better frozen pizza. It was mushy and cold to top it off. I would say come for the drinks. Just make sure you're not too hungry beforehand.
Stephanie P.,Hollywood  CA,207,218,116,12/26/2014,1.0,I use to love coming here  but now i dislike it. The service is horrible. The food is not made with love anymore. I decided to try the new carne asda fries. STAY AWAY from them  they are definitely BLAND. BJ's has too many items on there menu and usually when they add on instead of removing items from the menu  then the restaurant starts going downhill. BJ's you definitely need to make changes.
Jonathan C.,North Hollywood  CA,83,3,,1/24/2016,4.0,Great experience. We were a party of 15 and took less then 10 min to be seated. Our waiter I believe by the name of Scott was incredibly amazing! He knew what we wanted and didn't take long. The food was great as well as the pazookie!
Dulce D.,NORTHRIDGE  CA,198,96,72,12/3/2012,5.0,Came Here last night for dinner right after the La Auto Show... It was worth the drive. hahha Came in perfect timing because we got seated right away. This was like around 6:30pm. The food is delicous ... I order chicken parmesan... Very good and filling.... I had no room for the delicious :( dessert   but next time for sure hahah :D
Winston S.,Hermosa Beach  CA,92,445,82,8/30/2011,3.0,I've been going to BJ's on and off for 10 years now  and always loved their pizza and dessert. The food was good as usual  but our server wasn't too friendly nor attentive. They don't sing for birthdays apparently either. The reason for the 3 stars is the food  but the service made me remove 2 stars.
Molly N.,Sylmar  Los Angeles  CA,2,24,4,2/25/2015,1.0,"Ordered 2 pizookis and an order of mac n cheese. ON THE PHONE .. went in about 25 minutes later...I get there and the take out girl had her boyfriend holding her around the waist whispering in her ear...Ew? I\'m trying to eatI go up to ask for my order waiting for her to finish her conversation with ""Romeo. ""My order isn\'t ready -__-I sit down for another 20 minutes...at this point I\'m annoyed..I go back and ask if it\'s almost done..she said your mac and cheese has been done were waiting on the pizookies. .I sit another 15 min. ..mind you the lobby is EMPTYI say just give me the mac n cheese . I have to go  she says hold on walks to the kitchen to call her manager (he needed to delete it off ) At this point Romeo left..Juliet is acting like such a GREAT employee now  the manager says nothing..No ""what happened "" no ""hi how are you"" nothing .I told him ""hi I been waiting almost an hour for a pizooki I ordered over the phone. .while your employees are making they\'re own soap operas. Smh...He still had nothing to say! ! No sorry  NOTHING At this point i lost my appetite and left the Mac got my money back I now go to the BJ\'s in glendale."
Salvador E.,Sunland-Tujunga  CA,0,3,,1/31/2016,1.0,Seems you gotta be white to be seated in a timely manner....RACISM comes in different forms...
T G.,Huntington Beach  CA,5,135,143,10/16/2014,2.0,I love going to BJs restaurant in general  but this location leaves something to be desired. I'm on the fence about giving 2 or 3 stars. Annoying parking situation  restaurant was freezing inside  was brought the wrong food (I have a food allergy and had ordered a specific meal) so I had to wait while they remade my dish  was offered a desert to compensate for mix-up (never saw it)  had to wait forever to flag down our server to get the bill. Yeah I think I will stick to the Brea location where parking is free and the service as always great.
Christopher G.,Burbank  CA,12,16,2,3/23/2014,1.0,There's a Dog in the restaurant isn't that a health code violation??? Egg rolls where very hot and burned the top of my mouth  pizza was soggy wet like it was under cooked. Place is going down hill.. Maybe it's just this location..
Anna T.,Burbank  CA,49,51,8,11/26/2015,1.0,Last night I was at bjs  I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for dinner  while sitting there I noticed a bug inside my bread  so I was waiting for our waitress to come  but she never did. (She never even refilled my ice tea!) So I flagged down a another waiter and showed this to him. We all stopped eating our food because we were disgusted of what we saw we had no appetite to eat anything else. The manager came 15 mins later. She was a tall skinny girl with glasses. (She didn't introduce her self so I don't know her name) she went to the wrong table and then came over to us and said I heard there was something wrong. She didn't even know what was wrong. Wow! I explained what was wrong  and she said she was sorry. She wanted to know if she can get us anything else  we explained we were done and we didn't want anything else (after seeing that we don't have appetite for anything else) she said ok  and only took off the fettuccine Alfredo. (Yes I know she should have removed the dinner from the bill that had a bug in it) As a manager or whatever she was because she never introduced herself  she could have handled it a better way. This was the last time I am going there. FYI please train ur managers to introduce theirs selfs and train them to handle a situation a little more proper. Clean ur kitchen! Seeing a live bug in ur food is not appetizing!!!!!!!
Artemis P.,Burbank  CA,2,6,1,1/12/2015,5.0,The only restaurant in the area that was willing to play a Los Angeles Kings game for paying customers. From the hostess to management  everyone was courteous and friendly. The food was great  as usual.
Pablo C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,2/12/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Came last night for my brother's birthday. I got some of the best service I've had in a while. Scott was our server and the dude killed it. Attentive  nice and great cameraman. Food was awesome and it all came out fast. I'm glad I went. Thanks Scotty.
Sandra M.,Houston  TX,53,95,4,9/6/2013,3.0,I Went with my cousin and friends while out here on a business trip and the food was consistent with all other BJs locations I have visited. The place was clean  the service was fine. My slightly dirty martini was made right  although it could have been shaken a bit longer to make it colder.My Parmesan crusted chicken tasted good.
Franz C.,Santa Clara  CA,30,16,3,10/26/2013,5.0,First time in BJs in Southern California. This place was super busy yet a very big establishment. We got out seats within 10-15 min. And our sever was cool! The food was good and the pizzokie was really good! I would come back here but maybe at a less busier time.
Alina S.,Los Angeles  CA,45,45,670,10/18/2014,1.0,Been coming here for years and unfortunately what I experienced here tonight  I was really disappointed. Place was a freezer  our waiter he was sick and didn't look right. I felt bad for the guy that he had to be at work with that condition. He was coughing while taking our order and I didn't feel comfortable with that. I had to give 1 star just to be able to post this review.
Katy P.,Burbank  CA,136,5,2,12/30/2014,1.0,Terribly disappointed.. I have been to BJs 2 times within the month... I used to love this place as a kid  but I suppose being a kid my food pallet usually consisted of Kraft Mac n cheese  hot dogs and McNuggets. I came on a date with my boyfriend. I ordered my favorite appetizer  the avocado egg rolls... Well apparently they come cold and with a slap of buffalo sauce on the side of the plate... On top of that  our appetizer came after our meal. Although I talked to the manager and she was very nice and gave us a gift card to come back and get another order of my favorite apps. Well  this time  my friend and I ordered the pazooki trio to go. One Oreo  one peanut butter  and one chocolate chip. The Oreo was great  but my peanut butter and chocolate chip were totally burnt.... I'm just totally disappointed....In all honesty  if I'm in the mood for a big cookie with ice cream  I'll be next door at Black Angus.
George H.,Los Angeles  CA,45,50,12,8/25/2013,3.0,The service here is slow. Not by fault of the servers but the kitchen is holding up the show. We had ordered and waited nearly 40 minutes for our food to show. We had 2 salads  a flat bread pizza  Mac and cheese and a deep dish for 4 people. The pizza came out cold. We asked if they could reheat it and the server apologized and took it back right away. We didn't complain but a manager showed up to our table right away and said he would Comp us the pizza and apologized again. He was on top of things and saved the dining experience. He even brought out the hot pizza himself and apologized. This gives me notion to give them another chance but the kitchen has to step it up. The food was great otherwise and their craft beers are always a pleaser. When the kitchen can keep up this place will be solid for anyone. Until then they need to fix the issue  but keep the great service the wait staff and manager have. Good job to them. Will defiantly be back for seconds.
Lianne O.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,16,254,59,10/14/2014,3.0,My friends and I waited for 30 mins at our table before a waiter came to take our drink orders but luckily for the waiter  we were so into our convo having fun that we didn't even care. The waiter was so delightful and made sure he made up for his long absence but we assured him it was ok. The food was okay  it wasn't amazing. I expected more from my balsamic chicken :-/. The mashed potatoes were amazing though! It was nice experience but would prefer elsewhere.
Chlo M.,LAKE VIEW TER  CA,327,372,173,11/8/2012,5.0,5 stars definitely for this particular BJ's since they're a chain restaurant. I love this location  it's my go-to. I've been to the one in Glendale and did not have a good experience (hair in my wonton says it all). Their food here is really good and no hair :]. They're service is good as well  for all the times that I've been I always have a pleasant time. I do have a few yummy in the tummy choices but I forget their names  I only know them by photos on the menu haha sorry. The only go-to I can tell you is to get a pazookie!!!!!!!!! The most amazing thing ever and now that I'm thinking about one  I really really want one.!!!!!!!!So go and enjoy!!!!
Aerial C.,Studio City  CA,1,3,,1/19/2015,3.0,I am new to yelp and like to give good reviews  but about a month ago I went to BJs here in Burbank and received TERRIBLE service. The server was rude and the food came out cold. I had to wait for my food while my friends was already out. This is not good service. I have been to BJs before and like the menu and usually get prompt and friendly service. I did like the way the manager handled the situation  but now I will think twice about going to BJS (Hooters has just as good of food selection and service) so humphh.
Brian C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,14,,1/14/2016,5.0,This restaurant is always good. The food is great and the staff is always friendly and prompt. I've been going there for a few years  and on the rare times there's a problem with the food  like it wasn't served hot  they immediately - no questions - bring me a new dish freshly cooked - never reheated. The bartenders are always terrific and treat you like a regular customer. My only complaint is that they took one of my 2 favorite dishes off the menu. But chain restaurants are known for changing their menus regularly.
Anna T.,Valley Glen  CA,10,21,31,4/28/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Had lunch overload today!!!!Margahrita FrescaChicken wingsCrispy fried artichokesGourmet melt burgerNd finally ... :) Triple chocolate pazookie!!!! 5 starzzz!!! Woot woot
Marice S.,Burbank  CA,18,34,20,7/27/2013,3.0,"To sum  BJ\'s has a decent deep dish pizza  the only reason I gave it stars at all. But let\'s talk about their curbside service  shall we? What. A. Joke. It\'s not convenient. It\'s not fast. And it certainly doesn\'t make sense. So one evening  we decided to order take out for said pizza. We placed an order online and saw they had curbside pickup. Sure  why not. When our pizza was ready  we drove to the special parking spot in front of the restaurant and called the number on the sign.The guy who answered said  ""Let me guess  an order for Dave."" Me: ""Um no  this isn\'t Dave.""How about less guessing and more getting the order right. So we told him our last name and he said they\'d be right out. Now in this time  another customer had parked next to us  walked into the restaurant and returned 5 minutes later  food in hand. Ok  so we chose the wrong take out method. When a server finally came out with the food  I handed her my credit card. She had to walk back to the restaurant to ring me up  then back out to give me the receipt. What  no mobile credit card reader? Sigh  I don\'t know what I was expecting but it sure wasn\'t that. And as for the pizza  it was already soggy and cold by the time we got home. Curbside service can kick it to the curb."
Cynthia S.,Granada Hills  Los Angeles  CA,382,284,61,7/2/2012,4.0,AAAAAAAhhhh... Back to this location for the Avocado egg rolls I adore so much... Service is always good  and friendly! Went there for a girls night couple of weeks ago  got seated right away (at a booth) we asked the waitress if they could give us the happy hour prices even though we weren't at the bar area  she asked the manager and agreed! (non of us got drinks) Wth happened there? lolFood is always consistent and delicious... They have a huge menu selection  so something to eat for everyone... not a big fan of their pizza but other things usually all taste good. Service has been been good on some nights and bad on others... Pizzookie is fantastic!!! make sure you always save room!!
Erin A.,Henderson  NV,21,41,3,9/14/2013,4.0,This was our first experience at BJ's and I have to say it lived up to all the hype. Everything  and I mean everything we had was delicious. First we ordered the Best beginnings appetizer combo  I tried everything but the avocado egg rolls. The Santa Fe Spring rolls were my favorite. The mozzarella sticks were skinnier than I am used to  coming from Wisconsin where we love our cheese. I was very impressed once I tried them though! We also got the chicken pot stickers  which would of been good if they hadn't sat under the heat lamp waiting for our other appetizer to arrive. They were just a little crunchy on the outside.   Our waitress was really great at telling us what she recommended and was always on time with our soda refills  which is a must for us! We really hate to wait for refills :)  Next  I ordered the Blonde Fish and chips. Best fish I have had in awhile. Just squeezed a little lemon on them  and they were perfect! Even my husband  who is not a fan of fish  decided to try it  and fell in love! Said he may even order it next time! All in all  very  very pleased with our visit. We will be back again soon.
Marconi De M.,Los Angeles  CA,102,454,5,7/20/2013,3.0,They improved adding some other craft beers to the menu  they have a nice variety of items on their menu  but it's been a long time since I found a server so unprepared like we had. Taking nearly close to 10 minutes to bring a beer and rushing me asking if I wanted to order food while waiting for the beer... duuuhhhhBy the way... I had to get along with my 3rd beer selection... the first two weren't available... only their house IPA... weird... at least... I keep trying wishing it works better next time but I get disappointed every time. It's not bad... it's just another average beer bar where nothing stands out with a terrible service.
Tyler M.,Burbank  CA,26,39,5,10/25/2014,4.0,Service can be spotty  but it has improved from previous years. The food is always good  especially their pizzas (Buffalo Chicken is my favorite) and priced appropriately. Drinks and beer are good too.
Natasha A.,Northridge  CA,3,6,3,7/6/2014,3.0,Me and my coworkers come here almost every friday and saturday night around 11 or 12 after we get off work from down the street and I don't know what it is but every time we come here we always receive bad service. I dont know if it's our timing or what but there hasn't been a time where something hasn't gone wrong and it doesn't matter what waiter. It's too much to write because my list can go on and on but for one we never get our drink refills until AFTER we get the check -_- Honestly the only reason why we come back is because we like the food and it beats waiting an hour at buffalo wild wings. We always hope that the next time will be better but it never is. We like to sympathize with our waiters because we work in the food/service industry as well but to get bad service every single time is just weird.
Lisa M.,Burbank  CA,0,35,,6/4/2014,1.0,Walked in.... A baby strapped to a bar stool AT THE BAR... Babies at the bar. Repulsive. I don't care if it's legal... It's repulsive.
Zachery E.,Los Angeles  CA,3,4,,7/9/2012,1.0,Really BAD!Food is decent. Service is okay. I came here after work starving. Some coworkers and I ordered a pizza to share and drinks. When the waitress finally brought our food out it was the wrong pizza. She took it back informing us that they would make a new one. That took about 15-20min. When she was on her way to bring it she drops it all over the floor and has to go back to make another one. We waited about and hour or more till they were able to bring it out to us. It didn't taste good and kind of dry for my liking. We ate and we were given our check and they charged us for the wrong food. Overall horrible experience.
D D.,Glendale  CA,0,1,2,2/11/2015,1.0,I ordered from them 2 days ago for pick up  i was surprised when I opened the boxes at home. I was one of their fan before  I saw my order. I will Never go or order from them again. It seems like they throw my food on the boxes and the fries were awful and bad quality same as the food. So disappointed.
Charles D.,Los Angeles  CA,1,48,86,8/23/2013,2.0,Not sure what happened here but over the last few years this particular store has seen a decline in food quality. When they still served their deep dish in the pan instead of plate  pizza's were fluffy  crispy and delicious. Coming here at least once a month if not more  I didn't expect such a drastic drop in quality over the past year -- maybe they're no longer using fresh ingredients or modified the original recipe. In any case everything here is now bland  tasteless and seems to be focused around quantity rather than quality. Suffice to say  I'm no longer a regular.
Shylo G.,North Hollywood  CA,29,11,12,1/1/2015,4.0,We came to watch the college football game for the rose bowl. We had 2 different waitresses. The 1st was OK closed our tab and then didn't tell her replacement to come cause we were gonna be here a while. 2nd one comes her name is Maria. Let me tell you she is on it. She is always checking on us. The food was great. I'm a fan of lots of lemon in my water and she even brought me a plate full. Can't complain
Genevieve P.,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,5,11/24/2013,5.0,This place has been my family's number 1 choice to go eat dinner for about two or three years now. The waitors never fail to keep you satisfied and most of the food on the menu is very good. I always perfer the pramasian crusted chicken. Finally the main reason this is my family's favorite is the pazookie  who does not love a warm cookie topped with ice cream yumm!
Paul C.,Chicago  IL,16,1,,12/30/2014,1.0,The waiter apparently added $5 tip to himself... My bill was $67 during bank process.. After the bank process $72... We left the tip in cash. I will make this short  we order too much food for a small table  ask the waiter to change table  he didn't help us  just walked away... Maybe it was because I wrote how horrible the service was on my printed receipt ...
Mako E.,Los Angeles  CA,27,21,,10/12/2015,1.0,The receptionist said that we would get faster service at the bar for lunch so we sat there. We spent over a hour and 20 minutes slowest service I've had for an order of chicken wings  a burger and a sandwich. One server for the busiest area and it wasn't even that busy maybe 20 people.
Nance B.,San Fernando  CA,0,6,1,11/16/2015,5.0,Awesome server! We went on a Saturday afternoon  so no waiting. I realize there are plenty of places similar to BJ's that offer a quick bite and some beer  but what made BJ's different was our server. He was just amazing! The young man who served us made it one of the most pleasant experiences I've had in years at any restaurant. I didn't get his first name but I think he mentioned his last name was Boss  which is fitting because he should be promoted to one soon. He not only did a great job answering all our questions (since we rarely come here) but he spoke and socialized with my 6yr old directly. He was great with my son and didn't dismiss him when my son tried to engage him in conversation. You stood there and acknowledged my kid  and he really felt special because you included him in the conversation. So I will definitely be coming back   and hope all your staff is as great as Mr. Boss.
Ani B.,Griffith Park/Los Feliz  Los Angeles  CA,39,187,156,2/26/2013,5.0,Had the pazookie trio! YUMMMM! Red velvet pazookie sucks!Cookies and Cream----DELICIOUSSSS!!!!Chocolate Chip---YUMMMYYYY!!!!It is heavenly people! I think I am driving myself crazy thinking about it.
Robert D.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,236,285,113,8/31/2014,4.0,This place is good. Always fast service unless ehe you sit outside. But the pazooki is the best.
Robert M.,Jersey City  NJ,1,2,,1/19/2015,3.0,A bit disappointed as I've been to others in Florida  Arizona and Los Vegas. The service was slow and the atmosphere just not the same as experienced before.
Jeniffer I.,Palm Springs  FL,2,18,6,8/21/2013,1.0,I picked up a pizza here and I was very disappointed. I expected better. Is almost similar to dominos pizza yet not as good. I've had lots of pizzas from all different places so for a medium pizza that cost me $22 it wasn't worth it.
Chantal B.,Saint Louis  MO,21,22,11,8/13/2013,2.0,This BJs location is really subpar. Every time I go here I kick myself for not going to the Glendale location.The food is ok  but the service is slow and not really all that friendly. If you have a craving for BJs  go to the location in Glendale on Brand Boulevard. Sure  you may have to pay for parking  but you'll have a much better experience!
Jessica G.,Burbank  CA,14,17,4,6/16/2014,3.0,I've been there twice (lunch n dinner) and were not fun and amazing experiences. The food is so delicious  yet the servers are too sluggish.
Claudia R.,Milford  CT,93,677,2,4/2/2013,3.0,Pretty average Saturday afternoon lunch here. Good service. the veggie burger was good. I can say  however  that their beer tasted pretty darn good!Maybe I'll stop by again when I go to Ikea!
Andrew F.,Carlsbad  CA,37,175,25,3/13/2011,5.0,GET THE OREO PIZOOKIE!The first time I had BJ's I was in college. It is one of my favorite restaraunts  and I'm super happy we got one in Escondido. I wish it wasn't so popular
India C.,Costa Mesa  CA,26,56,34,3/29/2014,2.0,I tried this place twice  I was excited because we didn't have to chain back home in GA and ppl always raved about the Pizookies. The pizookie and strawberry lemonade are their saving grace - this place is lacking in every other area from customer service to seasoning on the food. The food is bland  mediocre at best! I don't see myself coming back here!
Orsolya D.,North Hollywood  CA,826,796,1409,4/18/2010,3.0,"Am I the only one that always thinks of vulgar sexual jokes when it comes to the name of these brewhouses? I\'m thinking that was their intention. It\'s a marketing gimmick to bring attention to the establishment. I know how this works. I was a marketing minor in college... Well  job well done BJ\'s! Hahaha BJ\'s ;) Anyway  putting my immature 12 year old version of myself aside; the BJ\'s location in Huntington Beach was one of my first reviews on Yelp. It was so horrible; I gave it one star  emailed the corporate BJ\'s  and swore off the establishment for life. Tonight  I ventured to BJ\'s in Burbank with some other Yelpers (Val  Jessica  and Anthony) and can say that Mr. BJ gained back some love (I\'m still weary but I\'ll give it SOME credit). The Burbank location is very spacious with several eating areas and two bars. The seating resembles a cafeteria in size and layout so don\'t be surprised if you feel the need to look for the ""popular kids"" or the ""computer nerds"" and revert back to high school. We ordered the Pizookie Platter with half chocolate chip and half Oreo and the Beer Sampler. The Beer Sampler included about 8 or so varieties of beer ranging from light Belgian-like beers to dark twins of Guinness. The waitress politely explained each and even asked later in the evening which we liked  etc. An excellent way to find a beer you like for your next visit or feel like a beer connoisseur to impress your friends. The pizookie was fresh  soft  and MUCH better than the raw cookie dough at the Huntington Beach location. Overall  a much better treat which we engulfed like children. Maybe BJ\'s isn\'t that bad and the OC just offers bad service. I suppose one can\'t go wrong with a BJ!"
Stephanie L.,Santa Monica  CA,257,671,6,8/20/2010,4.0,The biggest draw for me to BJ's are the pizookies. That's really it.Since I can't JUST have a pizookie for dinner  I also ordered the healthiest thing on the menu--Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I really enjoy buffalo sauce  so I got a side to dip my pizza with. The small pizza was enough for me to save half for another meal.I was going to order the Pizookie Trio  but my friend wasn't up to the challenge of eating a pizookie and a half by herself so we just got a regular chocolate chunk pizookie. I sat there waiting in anticipation for the yummy gooey goodness to arrive.It was like one of those moments out of a movie where everything moves in slow motion and the light seems to shine a little brighter like a spotlight on the waitress as she makes her way to our table. The ice cream was slowly melting so I dug right in. Pizookies are absolutely amazing and I was VERY happy.My waitress was helpful  a little slow but super nice. There was a little 10 year old boy in the booth next to us who kept waving at me and even gave me a show using his hands as puppets. All in all  I had a wonderful experience at BJ's and will definitely be back.
J G.,Burbank  CA,0,15,2,1/23/2014,2.0,Terrible food. Ordered the Thai Salmon that came out without the vegetables and salsa that was shown on the menu.To the staff's credit  was quickly rectified by management so the service was ok. Not great though.oHowever  when the fully loaded salmon came out  the vegetables tasted like rubber processed garbage. Not great at all.
Tuesday H.,Ventura  CA,0,18,,9/26/2014,5.0,Lidia is an amazing waitress. good service  good food  && very attentive :)thanks for the birthday pazookie. (:
Richard R.,Escondido  CA,41,26,13,7/14/2013,2.0,Entre came out right after appetizers. Burger was over cooked. We sent it back  and again it came out wrong.The manager at least tried to be helpful. I think what really made this experience awful was our first waiter was fun and attentive  but he went off shift. Our replacement waiter was the opposite. Just not a good experience  and we're very unlikely to return.
Conor B.,Chatsworth  CA,162,1341,106,6/26/2012,3.0,I can't think of a time I've been to this location when it wasn't absolutely packed. I've even been here where they've lost our reservation (and when you show up with a party of 12 that can be quite a problem). However  the wait staff have always been beyond friendly and helpful which make up for any frustration before being seated.
Kevin P.,Los Angeles  CA,3,121,3,10/17/2014,4.0,Food was good but this one waitress too talkative...i thought she was my friend or something. Little too far there. And it felt like the wait was longer than other BJs
Arpi M.,Glendale  CA,129,46,,1/29/2014,1.0,Not a fan of this place. My food always comes cold and looking messy. The waiters/waitresses are rude and full of nasty attitude. I don't plan on coming back to this restaurant ever again.
Julia K.,Los Angeles  CA,0,19,,12/12/2014,2.0,I had a pretty bad experience here. My toddler was sleeping and we were seated in the bar area. Service was bad and different waiters would be waiting our table and drop silverware or plates on the table loudly. The food wasn't very good in comparison to other BJs we've been to which is inconsistent.
Betzabeth A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,1,10/3/2013,5.0,This food was super yummy and you get very big portions. I ordered pasta and my boyfriend ordered jambalaya. Also our server was very attentive and quick. I suggest you call head though  it gets pretty full. Thank you Stephanie Z!
Irene O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,1,6/15/2015,1.0,Parking sucks. We drive a Chrysler 300 and when we went up to park the bottom of the car got scrapped. I asked if we could park downstairs but they wouldn't allow it because the bottom parking belongs to the valet parking. The other option was to park a block away. So much for customer service. Because of that I will not take my business to BJs anymore.
Marc B.,Sepulveda  CA,156,104,80,7/11/2010,3.0,Beeer!So this place is as chain as you can get  but it's pretty decent with pretty good food  and pretty decent beer. The taste of the food is pretty greasy  even if you got salad.Recently  my friend and I got some drinks and the pizookie and it was pretty good. Specialty: Pizookie and pizzas. Beer is specialized here but tastes pretty much the same as the others  really.Recommendation for first timers: Pizza and pizookie with a pint of Hef  if that's what you're into.Service: 7/10  Atmosphere: 8/10  Theme: 9/10 (I like the subtle communist themes lol)Be careful at the Burbank location with the parking as there is a steep hill going up the second level.marc out.
T M.,Burbank  CA,0,41,27,4/2/2015,1.0,The service was terrible and the food was bland. I wouldn't come to this place again. Just stay on San Fernando Blvd.
Marisa Z.,Altadena  CA,315,411,111,1/29/2013,4.0,***Bar Review***  I have never sat in any of the dining rooms at this or any other location. I have always sat at the actual bar or one of the surrounding high top tables. I don't really care about the whole service aspect of the dining room in corporations such as this one. They always seem to coddle you  filled with fake enthusiasm and try to push things on you that you have no desire for. The bar area is easy  laid back  chill. Plus during breaks in conversation  while say your friend went to the restroom  you can catch the scores to every game.   The happy hours are pretty decent here too  there are two of them. One during the traditional hours one would normally be use to seeing post work  as well as the reverse happy hour that starts at 9  i think  and goes til closing.   The food is decent  better than I anticipated actually. The beer is great  I really enjoy the red  and usually stick to this over the others. Although the last time I was there I noticed something new  guest taps!! And quite a lot to boot too. I was surprised as well as curious and made a mental note to look at the list next time.   The service has generally been great  smiling happy servers that seem genuine rather than acting as if they care.   Remember to stop for cash for the valet. The first time I came here I was driving my manual transmission Mustang and opted to park it myself in the structure. The ramp that leads up to the top floor is steep as hell!! I was super thankful that no one was behind me or in front of me. I could have rolled or stalled. It is that steep. I can't remember how much valet is  I have a truck now that is automatic and the steep incline is just plain fun now.
Kait R.,Houston  TX,205,379,207,5/7/2010,3.0,The first thing that comes to mind when I think of BJ's is their Pizookie. It's definitely one of my favorite chain restaurant desserts. The buffalo chicken pizza is good with ranch and the beers are a nice bonus. BJ's is good for a big group of people who like different things because their menu is pretty extensive. It's also fun to take someone who just turned 21 and introduce them to the beer sampler.The problem I have with BJ's is the service is always bad and the food isn't consistent. I can order wedge cut fries one day and order it the next day  and it's like two completely different plates of fries. Luckily  the pizza is consistent  but burgers and sandwiches aren't.
David M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,,12/3/2014,5.0,Always get great food and service here. Waiter took down my order correctly  but the chef had missed up. They re-did my plate and comped our desert. Always leave here happy.
Remy Y.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,10/25/2014,5.0,I have been here for 15 minutes and the service by the waiter Tyler has been nothing but amazing. He greeted us and made us feel very comfortable knowing there is a bunch of homecoming kids and it's super packed. Ensured us that no matter how busy is it his main focus is to take care of us. I highly recommend asking for this guy when coming in.
Hank K.,Los Angeles  CA,6,81,236,8/5/2012,2.0,"We haven\'t been back here in a long time. The facility is clean and the service is friendly enough. On par with what you expect from a chain. Although I didn\'t have any last night  the pizza is the only thing I\'d recommend if visiting a BJ\'s. It\'s fairly decent but not traditional Chicago style pizza. The best comparison I can make is Pizza Hut\'s pan pizza (I figure nearly everyone has tried that at least once). Thicker but not as dense with a chunky marinara sauce and overall better ingredients. Whatever you do  DO NOT order that ""Greek"" pizza. One of the worst pizza\'s I\'ve tried in my lifetime. Do yourself a favor and stay away from that bitter mess. The Pizookie(?) is a solid dessert. As a rule  most chains I review receive 3 stars as long as they\'re clean  consistent and efficient. A few years back we had our credit card information lifted and we have a strong suspicion it happened here. I can\'t prove it but I\'m still knocking a star off because I have a feeling I\'m right after retracing our steps. If I could  it would have received one star."
Luckiblu M.,Burbank  CA,6,40,16,4/6/2014,4.0,Great service....good place to watch the games & be able to eat decently. Awesome appetizers to boot!
Kay G.,Los Angeles  CA,36,248,48,1/2/2013,3.0,Went to this location in November for a small birthday celebration. This is the first location I've seen that has valet parking. The lot is small and the tiny parking structure is...tiny  but if you can manage to park in the structure then there's no need to fork over $6-7. Like every restaurant on a Saturday night  expect a long wait. Because I've only gone to this location once I can only say that the service for that particular evening was okay. The waitress came around a few times: once to take our orders  once to ask how everything was after our orders had been delivered (she didn't serve us)  and once to deliver the check. The waiter serving water came around more often.I'd return  sure. It's BJ's. Chances are the server will be different and my experience will be  hopefully  better.
Jenn C.,Burbank  CA,4,26,4,4/29/2013,4.0,I've ordered all diffrent kinds of food (salads  pizza  pasta  bugers  etc) and it's all been good. The service has always been very friendly. They are very accomadating for last-minute large parties. I've celebrated my husbands birthday there for the past two years  and they were very gracious when my party of 12 suddenly turned into a party of 20! My husband likes the selection of beers  and they have a lot of cocktails  but they are a little watered down.I'll definately be using them again for my next medium-large party.
B V.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,3,9/7/2015,1.0,The waitstaff is terrible and they sit you next to dirty tables. I've asked three times to have the dirty table next to me cleaned off and I've been sitting here for 20 minutes and it's still dirty. The table is full of plates  cups  to go boxes that people left behind. Just disgusting!
Ketevan E.,Burbank  CA,1,23,3,8/10/2015,5.0,ALEXANDRA My server was amazing !!! Sweet  professional & the best service I'v gotten in a long time ! I will come back :) plus the deep pizza was amazing
Benjamin R.,San Francisco  CA,320,6,,4/25/2012,1.0,Untrustworthy staff. :::BE WARNED:::. My credit card information was swiped from this location. It only place I used and left my credit card out of site while traveling in LA.Food was subpar as well compared to other locations.
Katherine J.,Los Angeles  CA,81,6,31,9/27/2014,1.0,I took my family here tonight. First they forgot my salad  I had to ask two different servers where it went. Our waiter tools me after ten minutes that someone else took it. There was a large and lid table next to us that always had their drinks filled and even when I asked for a refill on my water  I did not get one. Felt like I want worth the time. I then got my favorite dish  the balsamic chicken. I specified that I wanted light on the glaze  it came with more than double the amount. I had explained this to the server. He said  oh yes that is a lot more than normal. He spoke to the manager and they were unwilling to do anything about the issue. The manager didn't even have the courtesy to come apologize. Poor service. I wouldn't recommend this location.
Ally P.,Peoria  AZ,3,1,,8/26/2014,4.0,Had a great lunch at this location. Sat at the bar  bartender named Jesse provided EXCELLENT service. I'm not big on tomatoes but he suggested to keep tomatoes on the top of the pizza because they are cooked and seasoned  like having a little extra sauce on top! Salad was a regular caesar nothing special but still good. For lunch under $8  definitely hit the spot!
Katie M.,Burbank  CA,327,79,2,3/2/2012,3.0,There is nothing better than BJ's pizza and a pitcher of their brew for dinner and a PAZOOKIE for dinner (I go for the half peanut butter half chocolate chunk- YUMMM!). I love to sit in the bar area on game days since they have so many huge TV's. Add in GREAT happy hour menu and you are in heaven.
Mila D.,Palmdale  CA,22,84,1,9/25/2013,5.0,Seriously service is everything. Thank you Roy I will be back and will be asking for you. He is awesome. We ordered drinks... I had a caesar salad. I also had the nachos. And drum roll please... The pazooki with White Macademian.. Goodness it was amazing 3lbs later I will definitely be back. On a side note another yelper mentioned it  but the hostess did appear as if she had better things to do than to greet people at the door. She was clearly not thrilled to be there. Management might want to change that one out. Considering that is the first person you see when you walk through the door.Hire more people like Roy!!!!!!!!!!!
Jolyne C.,Burbank  CA,15,76,4,6/19/2014,2.0,Drinks are fantastic (especially the root beer)  but the food has been bad almost every time I went (and you can get a better tasting steak for cheaper at say  Outback.) The servers have always been pretty nice but a couple of times I went for takeout and the hostesses were rude.
MJ N.,Los Angeles  CA,2,40,3,6/17/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,OK  I think we're regulars. The food and beer have us coming back. Is it the best? No  but it certainly hits the spot. I also experienced the Pazookie for dessert for the first time. An absolute must try! They've added some dishes to the menu. I tried the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was perfection. Perfect portion  a light meal  great presentation  and very yummy. I highly recommend.We had a funny  attentive waiter again this time too. He was awesome!I still think it's a hit or a miss with this place  but lately it's been hit after hit. We'll be back again very soon  which is almost unfortunate because that Pazookie loving will start showing pretty soon...
Benjamin S.,Los Angeles  CA,13,110,22,11/26/2012,2.0,BJ's just isn't what it used to be. I had dinner here a couple nights ago and I don't need to eat here again for years (if ever again). I ate at BJ's a lot in college and it was great. Now  not so much. The pizza is nothing special. The appetizers we ordered were not good. Even the pizzukie was just ok. Maybe I've outgrown eating food like this?
Morgan S.,Burbank  CA,0,12,1,12/17/2015,1.0,Called BJs at 2:50 to make a reservation to eat at 5. Walked in just a few minutes before 5 and was told it would be a 15 min wait. Made reservations because our party had to be somewhere by 7 and we couldn't afford to be late. Was a little thrown off when we walked in and they said it would be a 15 min wait. Since it was my mom's birthday and that was where she wanted to eat I was willing to wait. We finally go to get seated and they attempt to put us in a small booth that might have fit 4 adults  mind you our party was 6 adults and two high chairs. We asked to get a different table with a little more room and they told us all the other tables had reservations....the place was practically empty! We asked to speak to the manager. He finally comes out and is rude. He goes on to say we actually didn't have a reservation it was actually considered a call ahead. He said the table they were offering usually fits 7 people. I couldn't help but laugh  there was absolutely no way! The manager made no attempt to even offer us a different table he just wanted to make negative comments towards us that we didn't have reservations. We walked out and called over to Gordon Biersch. They were able to sit us immediately and they were busy!!! They had great customer service and extremely friendly. We had never been before and our server offered us samples of beer so we could pick what we wanted to order to drink. Had a great atmosphere too! Highly recommend you head to GB over BJs! Gordon Biersch even apologized on behalf of BJs for giving us such a horrible experience. Needless to say I will never think to go back to BJs!
Michael P.,Sunland-Tujunga  CA,0,2,,9/13/2015,1.0,We have been here many times before but tonight's experience was terrible. The worst service and waited over an hour for our food. It will be a while before we return. I spoke with the manager and she apologized.
Liz V.,Los Angeles  CA,21,91,1,6/11/2014,2.0,"like most american chain restaurants  BJ\'s is whatever. i never crave it but if a friend wants to come here  i don\'t object. after so many times of ""hmm..i should try something different. the menu is pretty large...sandwich  specialty entree...""   i realized to just stick with what\'s good. appetizer: avocado egg rollsentree: pizza (any one)dessert: pizookie (so many options now...all delicious)drink: blonde; very berry cider"
Tiffany L.,Glendale  CA,23,24,5,9/12/2014,4.0,I love this place. Great variety of food and drinks. The beer is very delicious. The service is good nothing special. The pazookie are the best dessert. Make sure you order one!
Ralph T.,Stateline  NV,14,435,28,11/11/2012,3.0,Friendly staff. The normal BJ's restaurant and food. Not really too much to say about it.This is a kid friendly place with lots of TV's to watch sports.They have a full bar and happy hour.Food quality is good and what you would expect from this type of restaurant.
Alex S.,North Hollywood  CA,36,29,3,4/17/2014,5.0,It was the celebration of my lovely brother. Party of over 20 people. Service was great  the waitress took care or all of us. She was friendly and fun. We did order a lot and had different orders. Would definitely recommend this place due to the service and great food.
Steven G.,Portland  OR,69,4,,9/5/2015,4.0,Sorry for swearing  service at the front desk was less than friendly. The hostess never even looks up unless you summon her. I feel guilty posting that earlier but they more than made up for it after that start. Staff and manager were excellent and they do care about your experience. Food was really great and the desert was excellent. Great birthday dinner for my wife and family to end the day.
Aaron F.,Hermosa Beach  CA,206,424,,10/12/2012,3.0,As usual  this is your typical BJ's restaurant.One thing that kind of annoys with me this chain is the overburdened toppings on all the pizza's. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and every slice broke in half as I was about to take a bite. Maybe lay off a bit on the toppings?Service was really good from the hostess to the managers.
Taylor W.,Los Angeles  CA,536,34,12,6/2/2014,3.0,My friend and I have been going there once a week now. We've had some really good service but last night really made me upset. I had a salad that I asked for no cucumber  they messed it up once so they remade it and it still had cucumber  then my pasta came out. IT WAS COLD  they sent it back to warm it up it came back  I couldn't even taste a difference.. They ended up remaking it. I spoke to the manager which his name was jack.. Worst choice to do  he took ten minutes to get to my table and was laughing while we were telling him our issue. I will never go again when jack is working.
Jazmin B.,Sylmar  CA,2,8,14,7/27/2014,3.0,Super sad  ordered to go and my pizza was chewy  and lacked ingredients... I'm wondering if the quality of to go is different than dine in? We've been there before and it's usually pretty good  was thinking about having my birthday party there... But now I'm not certain that's a good idea. We paid 33 bucks for a chewy pizza  and a pizookie  it will probably be a while before we go back. On the upside my husband said it looks like they remodeled  and it looks nicer and wide open  the pizookie was very good too.
Kim L.,Los Angeles  CA,190,79,22,6/7/2014,5.0,Came here on a Friday night and the wait was only 10 min! Which was great how packed they where. So we sat down and ordered or drinks. Then after ordered are food. The food took longer then expected but our waiter Arnold was checking on us every 5 min and gave us free French fries and some drinks because are food was taking so long! Which was so nice of him. He always came by to apologies and was very attentive . On top of that our food came and he took $5 off my bill and gave us a free pizookie on the house! He was such a great waiter with great costumer service skills. Not once was I upset how long the food took to get to us. I will defiantly come back and request him to be my server! He was beyond great! And the hostess at the front desk was very happy and answered all my questions I had! They where so busy and so on top of there game still! One of my favorite BJ's I have gone to.
Zoey S.,Union City  CA,126,72,125,10/8/2013,5.0,Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Wait time was only 15 minutes for a party of 2. Our server was Lindsay and she was a great server. She was super friendly and attentive. We ordered lettuce wraps  chicken and salmon teriyaki. All entrees were delicious. Staff here are super nice.
Andre B.,Los Angeles  CA,2,32,,6/18/2015,1.0,I have been to many BJ's before  but the customer service in here is just terrible. Besides the fact that the waiter had an attitude deficiency as if the customers were the inmates of Alcatraz  the manager simply didn't care when she was asked to look into it. This place has really bad customer service issues.
Joel M.,Sunland  CA,71,22,5,9/11/2011,1.0,Made a reservation for 7  got there  made me wait 30 minutes till I asked why haven't I been seated  they gave away my seats to another party who only been there for 5 min  Yeah... that's all  we left and got tacosTip: don't make a reservation  you will probably get a seat faster
Jason O.,Pasadena  CA,233,280,6,9/21/2012,4.0,I have been to this location at least 3 times now.  Each time has been a pretty good experience. Once they made my pizza with cheese even though I asked for no cheese. they took it back and fixed it and gave me a pazooki for free.  That's good service.This trip there were no problems.  Great pizza  great sandwiches  and the pazookie is so good. This place could go up to 5 stars if they keep this up.
hrayr o.,Burbank  CA,79,7,5,8/16/2013,1.0,I love BJ's. I love how their menu  food and service is pretty much the same  regardless of the location. But I stopped coming to this location since the last time I ate here  and I doubt I'll be back anytime soon. On my last visit I had the worst waiter experience in my life. His name was David (if I'm not mistaking)  a young black male. If there was a contest for the most annoying person  i would definitely vote for him. I'm pretty sure that everyone else who was being served by him would do the same. I can't find the right words to describe how obnoxious he was and I don't even want to. It will take me back to that day and get me angry again. Thanks for messing up my dinner David. Now because of you I drive extra 5 miles when I want BJ's.
Jim D.,Burbank  CA,1,102,,3/20/2012,2.0,First off let's get this straight  this is not Chicago style pizza  not even close. It's just some deep dish swill. Real Chicago pizza is amazing  this is not.Now that we've got that out of the way let's talk about the terrible service you get here. If there are ruder waitresses than this place has  I've yet to meet them. I get it  the place is understaffed but here's a thought  swing by your customers' tables every 20 minutes or so to see if they've died yet. Cool?Next  damn this place is loud. It's like the trading pit for commodities in Chicago. Why is it so bloody loud? Also  ever notice and this is funny  they never  ever have the beer you want. Ever. How can a place that claims to be a brewhouse not have the brew you want? Lame  weak sauce  pass!
AnThony A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,14,,6/30/2015,1.0,let me save some poor unsuspecting sucker the time to come here the service = shit not only that the prices will murder your wallet 2 pizzas and 4 drinks over 60 wtf go to another place ppl
Dana P.,North Hills  CA,65,299,28,9/24/2011,2.0,"I struggled with my decision on whether to give this place 2 or three stars. I had to settle on 2 because I have had some of the WORST service here..EVER.The food is on par with any other BJ\'s location. My issue here is the service. Now  good customer service has never been synonymous with any BJ\'s I have ever been to  but this location has some major issues. Some of my favorite horrible customer service moments include:- Being seated at a DIRTY table. I asked the hostess to have someone clean off the table  and she brings ME a paper towel. Are you serious?! Did you put me on BJ\'s payroll and forget to tell me? After I told her that I wanted someone other than myself to clean it  she gets a bus boy who makes sarcastic remarks to me. The server is just the cherry on top and ignores me and my bf while being perfectly nice to everyone else in the place.- Being with a group making them LOTS of money (ordered pitchers of drinks  apps  entrees  the works!). We get to dessert and the pizookie comes out COLD...the ice cream wouldn\'t even melt. We tell our server (after waiting 20 minutes)  and her response is ""Well if you want me to send it back  you\'re just gonna be waiting even longer."" Really???? It took at least another 30 minutes to settle the check. We got the manager  who informed us that we had to wait for the server because of the way we were paying.WTF...I guess BJ\'s pays so well that these people don\'t want tips.The last time I came here was a few days ago and my experience was actually okay  but they really need a Customer Service refresher course!"
Amanda N.,Simi Valley  CA,0,3,,12/18/2015,1.0,"Extremely poor customer service. Walk to the counter to inform the hostess I had a reservation  she said it would still be 15 minutes to ""prepare"" our table. The place was empty except for the bar. She never apologizes for the wait or even acknowledge us. Once we are taken to the table  it would not fit our size of a group. We requested not to be seated in a booth and was told there were no other options  even though we were surrounded by plenty of open 4 seater tables. When we asked for the manager  he again never apologized instead wanted to debate what a call ahead vs reservation was  even though it was HIS staff that told us we had a reservation over the phone. These differences were never explained on the phone when the reservation was made. The manager made no effort to remedy the situation  explain or even apologize; therefore  we left. Myself  coming from a customer service background was horrified by the service from the front line staff all the way up to the manager. I would NOT recommend eating here. Customer service should be more important than arguing with a customer. Extremely disappointed."
Onion O.,Valencia  CA,12,13,2,5/24/2014,3.0,it was okay.i ordered a fettuccine chicken Alfredo.wasnt the best.
suzie b.,North Hollywood  CA,120,151,28,7/16/2011,5.0,Wow  i feel really bad that so many yelpers have experienced bad service here because our waitress was excellent!They have a few good beers on tap (better than Gordon Biersch  actually)  but i opted for a bottled Hoegarden. First beer that came out wasn't super cold....i told the waitress and she made sure the next 2 were just the way I wanted it.I had the margherita flatbread  which was delicious!!! They have a bunch of other really good stuff on the menu like the avocado egg rolls.And for the sports enthusiasts...plenty of flat screens!
Tim H.,Beverly Hills  CA,27,78,,4/24/2014,4.0,Irish root beer is astoundingly good.
Wendy S.,Van Nuys  CA,351,413,,12/19/2011,3.0,you know. what are you gonna do? the mister wants pizza  and it has to be gluten free. you take one for the team and head off to bj's so your manchild will be properly fed this holiday season. now  the service is fine  it's comfy for a large scale operation  and the waitress was so kind as to bring my a menu that specified all food ingredients to facilitate my decision making process. basically  what i discovered  is that other than chips  the only items at bj's that do not have milk are meat  poultry and fish are salads. so  to put it in a little vegan nutshell  bj's is NOT a vegan friendly joint! being a super good sport  i ate my salad sans half the ingredients and used tabasco for my dressing. which  at least  means my ensalada was not the originally designated over 1000 calories that the menu listed.
Phoebe Y.,Burbank  CA,153,19,4,5/5/2014,4.0,Most of the time I come here because it's one of the few places open late in Downtown Burbank. The food is always good and the staff is always kind. I've even come here without a reservation on the night of the Super Bowl and didn't have to wait long (I guess because the restaurant is so big).Overall it's a nice place to have dinner or a late night snack.
Jennifer L.,Los Angeles  CA,40,30,,3/8/2014,1.0,took the waitress an hour to come to our table after we were seated  I had to walk to the front and ask the hostesses what was going on and she had to go look for our waitress. Then she proceeded to take forever and talk to the fellow waitresses instead of serving us our dinner. Worst experience at a restaurant. The food was cold when it FINALLY came and she never offered to make up for the terrible experience. This solidified my feelings for chain restaurants.
Derek I.,Burbank  CA,1,27,,10/11/2013,1.0,I'm Derek  Party of 2. I was quoted a 25 minute wait time and after 30 minutes I checked in and they told me that I was three parties away from being called. After a total of 60 minutes I checked in again. Apparently they had me written down as Eric Party of 3 and had called for us 20 minutes before. Obviously we hadn't responded since we are Derek Party of 2.When we asked what the mix up was  they told us that we should have checked in earlier. When we told them that we had  they told us that we should have checked in again.Word of advice: Check in every time a party is called  even if a different name and a different sized party was called.
Keith S.,Glendale  CA,274,13,,6/6/2014,2.0,Very disappointing. Sat at a table with sun setting on us  preferred to move to another table next door with same server  yet hostess moved us into the BAR  with three TVs  not conducive to conversation. Ordered Bleu burger medium rare  came out well done  dry  not a good preparation...Granville much better. Slow  inattentive service  no check backs.
Wendy B.,Los Angeles  CA,37,7,2,5/5/2015,1.0,I'm giving one star no for the service!!! I went this past Saturday to this place and I'm giving one star for the valet parking in this place they stolen an iTunes gift card from my car so be careful if you leave belongings in your car it may disappear
Diane F.,Burbank  CA,28,26,8,6/21/2013,2.0,I really like BJs and have been there a few times  but this time  the food wasn't that great. The Strawberry Martini was excellent and the clam chowder too  but my meal which was Chicken Fried steak was awful. It was tough and the mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold. The gravy that came with it was spicy and I had to order extra because they barely put any on the potatoes and steak. Not happy with it. Should have stuck with a burger or sandwich. I wanted to order dessert  but the selection was either cookies with ice cream or just ice cream. So I passed.
Aimee T.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,1001,240,2087,3/13/2012,5.0,I love this BJ's however sometimes the service can suck during really pack nights. The food is always good. Great for curb side.
Burbank D.,Burbank  CA,0,21,1,7/5/2015,3.0,The food was pretty lifeless (the burgers are basically just circles of ground beef)  but the service was pretty good. Eh. I can see why people would come here for events  or if they don't know any other restaurants in the area  but I probably won't come back unless I'm going to an event. The food's not worth it. Don't expect a culinary treat.
Thomas M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,2,7/2/2015,2.0,"Did you know that BJs started out as a pizza parlor in Santa Anna  CA? Too bad they lost the recipe for pizza. How difficult is it to put on some sauce? Sent the first pizza back and the waiter requested ""extra sauce"" for the remake. About 15-20 minutes later and after my dinner companion completed his meal  the replacement pizza came out. No sauce but more tomatoes on top. Was so hungry  ate first slice and took the rest home so I could add some spaghetti sauce to give it flavor and moisture. Manager not thrilled that pizza was so bad  esp after being reminded of their history posted in their menu. Service is mostly good but have had tastier from food trucks."
M E.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,0,12,,11/11/2013,1.0,"Food hast lost it\'s quality  the deep dish pizza\'s are not worth it AT ALL! The ""entree"" salads are not enough for a light meal  and the customer service is just horrible. Don\'t waste your time."
Danny B.,Sun Valley  CA,5,13,2,4/17/2014,1.0,Horrible service.!!!!they do not know how to run a business and serve a customer. Saw roaches on the floor and they didn't even apologize wish I can give negative stars.
Eric W.,Canoga Park  CA,162,663,142,2/7/2010,3.0,The biggest complaint I have about this BJ's location is the parking. It's a narrow driveway that essentially requires valeting the car and the non-valet structure (top only) is a really small lot.I had to choose a restaurant for a work lunch and chose this restaurant because I like it and I knew everyone could find something they want. I've been several other times too including with my girlfriend and we had really good meals with solid service. The food is usually really good -- their menu is super diverse from sandwiches  salads  pasta and pizza. Their micro brews are really good too. I had one error on a visit here. We had just been to a USC football game and came for a dinner. The restaurant messed up our order for a calzone and not only did the manager come over and we got comped on the calzone but they gave us a free dessert. That made up for the error.The sports bar has a lot of TVs if you can find a seat. Also  there are several TVs throughout the restaurant to catch a game. It's also a great place to let kids run wild because it's so big.I'm up for BJ's Restaurant just about always and this location works. It's not as unique as other restaurants because it's like a high-end Chili's if there is such a thing  but everyone should enjoy it.
Logan G.,Los Angeles  CA,1,80,3,9/4/2014,1.0,I tried to come to this location this afternoon. The parking valet blocks off 80% of the parking spaces available there for paying valet customers. They told me I couldn't park on the ground level and had to park upstairs in their garage structure. Their second level parking had half of the parking blocked off as well. There were no spaces available and when trying to go back to ground level I had no choice but to exit the same way I took going up. There was no separate lane from ongoing and in going traffic. It's a really dangerous move to try and cause accidents. Shame on you for hogging all the parking. I will never go here due to crappy unacceptable parking ethics by your valet people.You will lose customers daily to Black Angus right next door. Get a clue.
Jean L.,Burbank  CA,424,331,141,2/16/2011,3.0,I love beer I love beer I love beer I love beer...I don't come here for a nice dinner with a friend.I come here for:The basketball games;Pitchers of beer;Shareable appetizers;And pizookies. I get the best beginnings appetizer  which is eh  because the Avocado Egg Rolls taste more like pure avocado than a roll; the Spinach and Artichoke dip is alright; the Mozzarella sticks are eh; the Santa Fe Spring Rolls are okay too  I eat them without the sauce. It's just something to snack on while watching the many TVs in the restaurant. I've also had many of the sandwiches they offer  they are OK too. I'd probably order only burgers if I had to eat here.If you don't care about foodie food  and instead care about 1) COLD BEER; 2) GAMES; 3) and DESSERT  this place is a 3-bird-1-stone hit.
D D.,Sylmar  CA,39,61,5,6/15/2011,2.0,"I was getting together with two really good friends and us girls decided to let the guy pick where he wanted to go. ""let\'s go to BJ\'s"". In my mind I thought Yuck.....but I don\'t like it when someone asks me where I want to go eat  I reply with Blah  and they say: ""No  let\'s go somewhere else"". I complied. This place is so boring to me. The menu is large but nothing seems appetizing.I decided to go with the Seared Ahi Salad. After all  how much can you mess that up right? It was decent. I asked for dressing on the side  which was a great idea  since what I got on the side was oil and chives......""Excuse me is this the dressing?""Not impressed. I don\'t really get this place  but know people that tend to disagree. BJ\'s I will have to pass on your extended menu. Third time is not a charm for you."
Juan R.,Sun Valley  CA,1,11,,5/9/2014,1.0,Found a hair in my food they denied it saying it was a shred of salary I'm not stupid. They made me feel very uncomfortable. Never going there again!
David S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,6/12/2015,1.0,For this experience  there should be no stars. I've been to other BJs before and generally they are good. This one was pathetic. I had a flight out of Burbank airport in two hours and my girlfriend and I were looking for someplace to catch a fast bite when we saw BJs and decided to stop. To begin with there was a birthday party with about 20 4 year olds screaming their heads off. That's what Chucky Cheese is for -- not a brew pub. It took a while for our server to take our order and we got a couple of pints of the house brews -- which were good. That was the highlight. We ordered burgers because we thought that would be fast. Wrong. Almost an hour after we got there our meal showed up. The burgers were supposed to be medium rare -- they were cold and well done --mine was thinner that a McDs burger.. I was supposed to have cheese  no bacon. I got bacon  no cheese. My girlfriend's potatoes did not show up with her order. By this time I was running late for my flight so we didn't have time to replace our order. I nibbled on a few fries  my girlfriend ate a few bites of her burger. We paid for the beers. And had to run to the airport. I just made my flight and had nothing to eat. All in all  a very miserable experience.
Adam D.,Modesto  CA,12,85,28,1/30/2014,4.0,Came here for just alcohol. Had a lot of drinks and they seemed to be done fine. Heard no complaints from the party I was with. Bartenders did a good job in getting the drinks out fast.
Benny S.,Los Angeles  CA,18,223,,3/25/2012,4.0,BJ's Restaurant is awesome. I consistently have a great experience here.Pros:- The Food. Other than the pizza  everything on the menu tastes SO GOOD. The flatbread pizza is great  but the regular pizza is below average. I recommend the Chicken Parmagian or their pastas. - Outdoor seating on a sunny day during lunch.- Extremely low prices for lunch specials.- Their brewed beers deliver a strong buzz. Porter is too strong  too dark though.Cons:- Valet parking during lunch  but it's totally free  and you can park a block away to the south on the street for free  fairly easily.- Pizza doesn't have enough sauce.- Some of the indoor wrap-around booths are uncomfortable to sit at. Stick with the classic table and chairs  or sit outdoors.
Tara H.,Inglewood  CA,2,7,,6/5/2013,1.0,I ordered a Medium-Well Sirloin steak with broccoli side dish. After 10 minutes they brought me an Over-Done steak and when I complained  the manager came and said they will bring another one soon because they have steaks on the grill already  but it took another 7 8 minutes. This was in a Thursday night at 10 o clock which is not that crowded. The second dish they gave me didn't even have broccolis!! Don't go to this branch. It is a waste of money and time.
Marie D.,Seattle  WA,17,147,,3/26/2014,3.0,Nothing special. Was able to accommodate a huge party which was good but the wait was long. Great bar area and right off the freeway. It just sucks that you have to pay for valet. Why can't I just self park for free?!
Elena S.,Burbank  CA,4,4,,4/6/2013,1.0,I don't usually waste my time with reviews but I had to say this ! I ordered chicken Marsala- flavorless   the side pasta was undercooked and flavorless as well just a hint of salt and a lot of oil! The worst food I have had in a while!
Danny M.,Los Angeles  CA,64,176,12,2/17/2014,5.0,Beer sampler platter times two gracias!
Vntg C.,Sunland-Tujunga  CA,20,3,,3/15/2015,5.0,I rarely rate  only when great or absolutely horrible... Shannon S. was our waitress and she was GREAT! Very funny  very quick  and professional  so much so that we even spoke with her manager before we left! Thanks you for the great service and hope you're getting big tips!!
R T.,North Hollywood  CA,7,14,19,4/29/2012,2.0,Good place for beer  and that's it. The food is terrible. Cut down on the menu so you guys can focus on making better food. I had rib-eye  only because everything else looked so bad  and seasoned fries  which were dry with steamed vegetables  which were more than likely microwaved.
Leticia D.,Glendale  CA,1766,726,226,4/2/2013,3.0,Mojito and pizza mood is what i was in for when i went to this place...tv playing sports bar and loud noise all around and people enjoying drinks so its a young crowd but i really didn't pick this place so i wasn't there to eat dinner just enjoy a quick meal and drinks...i haven't been back to this place in a while...
Hector A.,Sylmar  CA,127,127,19,12/17/2014,3.0,like previously mentioned  my ratings are 2/3 based on customer service and the first thing i encountered while asking for a table was a an extremely rude women at the front desk and a TERRIBLE host and waiter. left alone without any drinks for a legitimate 20 minutes BUT after that  food we ordered came out delicious and faster than ever experienced and our waiter was replaced with someone a lot more personable.
Kaitlyn R.,Burbank  CA,89,1,,1/5/2013,1.0,Piss poor and pitiful service by Brandon. Not only was he MIA for most of the time  but our entrees came out almost right after our appetizers. Drinks were not filled unless asked. He only asked two of our party of six if we wanted boxes  and finally brought the check BEFORE WE EVEN GOT OUR DESSERTS!!! The kitchen wasn't much better. Our party ordered two medium burgers and they came out well done TWICE. I finally just gave up because obviously they don't know what a medium burger looks like. Terrible. Will not be coming back and I suggest you do the same.
Gil G.,Burbank  CA,0,57,,2/14/2014,1.0,Never again.I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup. I kept finding chunks of inedible... stuff in there. I tried to eat around it (because I was hungry). Finally  there was a big enough piece so that I could examine it. It looked to be wood. I found several other chunks in there as well.Waited FOREVER for the waitress to come by so I could say something. Someone else brought my entree (and  at that point  I didn't really feel comfortable eating it)  so it wasn't until the end of the (uneaten) meal when she came by. I told her about the wood in my soup. She PICKED UP THE WOOD with her bare fingers and closely examined it. Pulled it apart to look at the fibers  ran her fingers over it  etc... Again  it had been in my mouth.Then she declared it wasn't wood and that it was probably part of an artichoke that had fallen in the soup. I eat artichokes all the time  and it wasn't that (and it was all throughout the soup)  but whatever. I waited her for her apologize and offer $$ off the bill or something. Nope. No apology. She didn't even take the price of the soup off. I was furious but didn't want to ruin my date by bitching about it  so we just paid & left.Never ever again.The next week  I went to a similar  but different restaurant in Burbank. My husband's spoon had a weird sharp ridge on it  so he mentioned it to the waiter (I know it sounds like we go to restaurants and bitch a lot... but we really don't!). The waiter brought him another spoon. Later  the manager came over and was SUPER nice! Very apologetic (even though we assured him it wasn't a huge deal)  brought us free dessert  and then took 50% off our check! All without us asking! We WILL be returning to that restaurant.
Diana V.,Woodland Hills  CA,895,219,50,3/8/2011,4.0,I was here on Sunday with a very close friend of mine for a lovely lunch date. We didn't want to over due it so we decided on getting the special Gourmet Mac & Cheese. Oh Goodness! It was Delicious. It was the perfect portion and it came with 2 strips of crunchy Garlic bread. Also came with a side of House Salad. It was just perfect. The Gourmet Mac & Cheese had the right amount of cheeses  crispy bacon bits and crunchy bits of bread. I enjoyed every single bite. Customer service was on point and pleasant. Cudos to our waiter Brandon who would stop on by and ask if everything was OK every 5 minutes:) I wish I had a Pizookie after this but I was way too full from this delicious meal. Will be back for sure! :)
Fred B.,Glendale  CA,507,122,,10/6/2011,2.0,Service? Hello? Anyone care????Went here for a quick Lunch... Cheese Sticks Medium Pizza Salad Pizzookie Total before tip? $59.
Melanie K.,Glendale  CA,20,86,3,10/6/2013,4.0,Yummmmmy! I've been to Bj's many many times  but not too much at this location  we came today for lunch with a group of friends and I must say this ones probably my favorite.I ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen.. AMAZING! It's a Brewhouse so obviously it's fresh beer which makes it a million times better. If you haven't tried a Hefe  your missing out. I also ordered a Crispy Jalepeno Burger and have it split to share with my boyfriend. They first brought us back half a slice with a full order of fries (apparently the other slice fell on the way to the table) so they brought us a whole new one with a full order of fries on the house! It was so nice to have it offered to us without even asking  I honestly wouldn't have made it an issue.Great service  great location.. they offer valet also for a cheap price. There is another Bj's around the neighborhood on Brand ave. but I would suggest coming here.. it's bigger and the service is better :)
Crystal L.,Granada Hills  CA,52,49,180,1/27/2011,5.0,I'm so glad Girly Adventure Day with Kaye A. ended with a Pizookie Trio and Strawberry Splashes!Happy Hour bar service was amazing! You know service was good when they bring the bill and you're excited to pay because you want to reward them with a good tip. What goes around  comes around.
Izzy M.,Glendale  CA,8,36,4,1/18/2013,1.0,"Went here for a birthday today. Waiter was aweful  he had a nasty attitude from the begining. Couldnt help with the menu and had no suggestions to give. Who hired him? Too bad I didnt get his name. I later got my chicken marsala dish  and the photo had mushrooms in it. I asked him why my dish doesnt have mushrooms and he said because its in the sauce. Umm then why is it showing in the photo on the menu? So in a RUDE way  he said ""do you want mushrooms?"" I said well i wanted it cooked with my meal  not on the side what the heck am I gna do with a side of blan mushrooms. Then again with an attitude and rolling his eyes looking annoyed he asked if ""I want mushrooms or not."" VEEEEEEEERY rude considering it is not my fault the maker of the menu included mushrooms in the dish. He completely forgot about our table of 10  never got refils nothing. And we were later charged with a $22 tip he did not deserve. If anything we should have gotten a comp for his nasty attitude.Cant remember his name he was a pretty white boy with nice skin.Definitely NEVER going back again."
Guillermo M.,Diamond Bar  CA,151,62,19,4/7/2013,1.0,Service was so-so. Had to wait to be attended to at the front counter... and wait... and wait. not enough silverware at the table so had to wait for that. I ask for the steak well done... not burned  hard  and cold. baked potato was cold. veggies were so so. By the time we left it was 8pm and the place was jammed... and i don't see why... i was not impressed. Won't be going there again.
Elle I.,Glendale  CA,8,14,2,1/6/2015,5.0,So I came to BJ's for my Mom's birthday today just the two of us...wanted to treat my mom. Anyways  we ordered the Lemon-thyme chicken  which came with an ample amount of veggies and rice which bedded the delicious lemon-herb chicken breast. The good was great as always  but I'm reviewing more for the customer service. Our waiter's name was Charlie  and he was the best waiter I've had in a very long time at BJ's. Charlie was very courteous  accommodating  and friendly! Somebody needs to make this guy employee of the month or something--seriously. I hadn't been to the Burbank BJ's in a very long time due to a past negative experience  but I'm so glad we went in today. The only thing I thought was kinda weird was the mandatory valet parking--I don't like leaving my keys with anybody. That's just me. I really don't think it was necessary to have a valet  when there was a plethora of parking spots available. Anyways  I'm sure anybody who comes to this BJ's and has Charlie as a waiter can agree with my comments. Thank you Charlie!!!!!! :)
Ethan B.,Riverside  CA,85,28,5,1/6/2014,4.0,Good food  Server was not very helpful and constantly had to wave her down to get something. Over all good place to chek out
Nora F.,San Diego  CA,405,235,45,1/16/2013,2.0,I go here because I love the pizza and of course the beer is great. This BJ's in specific makes me not want to go to BJ's anymore.
trinka g.,Glendale  CA,14,25,,10/1/2011,5.0,We have been searching for a decent gluten free pizza and beer house- and we found it here! The crust was delectable and the toppings were many  and the Red Bridge beer was awesome! I felt like one of the football watching crew and not left in the dark for food and good times! Thank You  BJ's
President Z.,Los Angeles  CA,0,4,,2/22/2014,4.0,BJs is not too bad. They got plenty of TV's to watch the sports. The food is pretty good. The best thing about BJs is the beer. They have an awesome selection.
Kim l.,Santa Clara  CA,588,1232,885,10/24/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,3.5 stars for the food Hawaiian aka sweet pig is ok. The bbq chicken is good. Thick crust pizzas. Hits the spot. If you can't find parking in the self parking area on the second floor of the structure just park a block away in one of the free lots or find street parking. The valet girl was not helpful at all.
Arbi G.,Glendale  CA,323,227,81,12/29/2013,3.0,First time visiting  food's not bad  service needs attention  specially when you order food and you do not get the condiments you order. You wait and look at your food and wait and wait. Food gets cold  does not taste right  so need improvement.
A H.,Vacaville  CA,0,67,10,1/10/2014,3.0,I would say this was okay. My husband and daughter ordered burgers and found them to be average to below average. My husband said the kind of beer they had was not very good either. I ordered an Ahi Salad which I thought was delicious although the fish had ALOT of sinew in it which I have never experienced with Ahi before. I did have some special requirements for my food with allergies and they did all of that correctly. Our waiter was okay  parking was free although you had to walk up/down a set of stairs to get to the restaurant.
Larae H.,Simi Valley  CA,41,120,20,12/2/2011,3.0,So I came here with a few friends on a Saturday night for dinner. We ordered the spinach-artichoke dip as an appetizer which came with colored tortilla chips & was very good. I ordered a wildberry mojito (definitely recommed trying one) and a garden medley salad for dinner. It looked really small compared to my friends BBQ chicken salad. And when her pizza came out  it was the wrong one. Overall I like this place. It's a good family restaurant. But if you're on a diet  definitely go somewhere else. I was totally shocked by the calorie content in some of the food. I mean my salad alone was 500+ calories  for a SALAD! But it is a good place to come  try a few different beers and watch the game.
Stephen P.,Los Angeles  CA,154,1099,2739,1/17/2009,3.0,"2.5 stars - it seems harsh  but this place was barely A-OK (3-stars) on my visit...hmmm  ok I\'m gonna round it up...I treated my colleague to lunch since the co. told her that her temp position wouldn\'t be there at the end of the month. Sad. So she ordered a pint of Piranha and a lunch special grilled chicken pasta with a side salad. I got the fish and chips (with a choice of fries or wedges) and an Arnold Palmer (why is the drink named after a golf pro?)Looking at my colleague\'s pasta it looked a little unloved. I didn\'t try it as my fish and chips arrived. The cod came in nugget-sized pieces  but one of them was grey instead of white like cod is meant to be. And the greyness had a watery consistency. Probably a bad bit of frozen fish. It happens. But then comes the condiment incident. Sarson\'s malt vinegar was a ""wow"" for me. But only at BJ\'s is the sprinkler cap missing (mine at home has a sprinker.) So  I go and sprinkle  but it turns into a pour  pour  pour malt vinegar all over the potato wedges which proceed to soak it all up :( Bollocks! The best thing is the free parking  the patio to enjoy the 75F temp on a balmy SoCal January weekday."
Brittany B.,Santa Clarita  CA,191,1065,133,9/8/2013,3.0,"Really nice servers but a few quarks that make the experience more of a three. I love BJ\'s in general  as far as chains go. The in-house brews are a treat  and the non-alcoholic homemade drinks (like root beer  cream soda  and orange cream soda) are a nice plus if you are with a group that is not in for imbibing (as was the group I was with). But when we arrived with our party of five adults and two kids  they placed us in a booth that was really meant for 5 max. We had to ask them to move us  which they promptly did  to a table in the bar area. But  really  who puts 7 people in a booth that small  especially on a very hot day and when tables in the bar are plentiful? Service was great  orders taken fairly promptly  and refills kept a-comin\'. There was a situation where two of the men in our group ordered bowls of clam chowder and got bread bowls instead  a minor mix-up. But towards the end of the meal our server went AWOL for awhile. This is less felt when you are with a big group and everyone is talking  but I noticed it. It was the very moment that my 6-year old wanted water to finish up his meal  and it took awhile from that point for our waiter to stop by so that we could ask for it. It was brought promptly from the point we could request it  and shortly after there was a shift change  so that could have been the reason. So even though the waiter was nice and helpful  just enough funky business to lose this place a ""4""."
Vvn W.,Van Nuys  CA,63,546,30,1/23/2011,2.0,I typically like BJ's; they have fun fabulous food and a lively dining atmosphere. Great for a lunch or dinner crowd  BJ's offers a rather huge menu of all types of foods and a variety of brew ha-has. There's something for everyone.This particular BJ's is somewhat disappointing. For one thing  the only parking the restaurant has is valet If you want to park in the restaurant's parking lot  it'll cost $3.50 plus tips for the valet parker. Most folks find nearby street parking to avoid this expense.Secondly the usual quick lunchtime service was unusually slow. For awhile we waited for the server to show up to take our order and then the fun begins: waiting over 20 minutes for food to arrive. I ordered the quite bland Pesto and Chicken thin crusted pizza which was served on the cold side. I had the server reheat it which took another 10 minutes. If I were to wait 20+ minutes for food  it should come to the table piping hot.Sorry but this BJ's didn't make the cut....
Dave K.,Thousand Oaks  CA,0,27,,3/31/2014,3.0,I go to BJ's about once or twice a month for lunch. The staff is usually very friendly and prompt although I go early. Once it gets crowded the it seems they are understaffed. The portions are usually pretty generous and the beer is good. Plenty of TV's to watch multiple games at the same time is always a plus.Valet parking is typical for LA - completely unnecessary. Why is it necessary to have valet with the lot and garage right there?!
Kevin C.,Irvine  CA,5,27,2,12/2/2012,1.0,Service was horrible. My girlfriend and I were seated and did not receive any service for more than 10 minutes. Annoyed by the lack of service  we thought we would try our luck in the bar area....boy were we mistaken. We sat for another 10 minutes and had to flag down a waiter who didn't even work in the section. Once we finally ordered and received our food  my girlfriend's burger came out charred on the outside and raw on the inside. After sending the raw burger back to the kitchen  no manger came to apologize for the inconvenience. I ordered something simple  a pizza  but it came out extremely dry. Needless to say  we were completely disappointed with our experience and walked out with made up minds that we will not be returning to this location.
Kristen C.,Sherman Oaks  Los Angeles  CA,112,76,61,10/11/2011,5.0,This review is long over due! I LOVE this restaurant  but the service is what puts it over the top. Maura Mitchell was our waitress  and she could not have been nicer! While I am almost an expert on the menu  I couldn't decide what I wanted and she suggested a Summer Special that was a Medium Pizza and a Pazookie for like $20! Which was MORE than enough for my friend and I  who are total foodies. I can't say enough great things about the great service we received  or the always delicious food! ps.. this review really is long over due.. Can't remember the exact price.. But it was still an excellent deal. =)
Tom N.,Cypress  CA,11,35,1,12/1/2012,2.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'s numerous times  because the location was just so convenient for a drink with friends. The more I go  the less I\'m impressed.The last time I was there was maybe a week ago. We got a pitcher of the Nutty Brewnette (if you like New Castle)  this is the one you should go for). I wanted some fries and some chicken fingers  which is only on the lunch menu. They were nice enough to accommodate it  but when this order came....it was like warm. Like it\'s been sitting on the counter. So I asked if I can have it fresh and the next order was hot on the ouside  but hard/warm in the inside (like it wasn\'t cooked through). I didn\'t want them to spit in my food so I just decided to shut up from this point on.We also ordered the blackened chicken cajun pasta. The garlic bread is not a bread. It\'s a huge crouton. The visit before this was worse in the summer when we sat outside. The server completely forgot about us. We ordered Martini\'s  appetizers  and the main dish (it was jut two of us). The main dish came. I was in shock  because we didn\'t have our drinks or utensils....and then the appetizers arrived  and then our Martini\'s. During this time  I continued to ask for utensils until I stood up to go ask and pick it up myself. I never get upset or complain  but I had to say something. I said  I normally would like my Martini and appetizers first before my main dish. The server\'s excuse was that it wasn\'t his shift and he was forced to cover....I just kind of sat there listening to him complain thinking....so what does this have to do with me and how are you going to fix it? He didn\'t care and it really upset me so I had to tell the manager. The manager just said he\'ll give us one of the dishes on the house in the attitude like as if he\'s saying  ""are you happy now?""I feel like the food and service gets worse every time I visit this location. The Woodland Hills location does a better job."
Alex M.,Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,7/24/2013,1.0,Worst chain restaurant in Burbank. Hands down.The food is truly disgusting and the staff does not have their act together.
Pearl V.,Culver City  CA,5,13,,1/19/2013,1.0,"Never going back to this location ever. Our server\'s attitude was terrible from the start. Then  our food took forever. Our server went on his break and the new server was terrible too. When our food finally came out  it was cold. When we flagged down a MANAGER she couldn\'t have cared less! Yes she took my plate to ""fix it"" but she also didn\'t apologize once and kind of just shrugged her shoulders! Then  she never once came back to check on us. Also  I ordered my steak medium  and it came back to me well done after they heated up the food. Overall just terrible service. We expected at least the manager to care and be more apologetic but nope! Awful."
Shelby S.,Burbank  CA,168,25,,11/17/2013,3.0,This place can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are and who is cooking. I've had better luck dining in rather than take out. They usually mess up the take out orders. Especially if it's later at night. Their pizzas are really good and I like the atmosphere.
David P.,Los Angeles  CA,127,21,3,4/9/2011,5.0,This restaurant (location  anyway) has some of the best service I have ever received every time I go. I remember once a few years ago we ordered some steaks and because the kitchen kept over or undercooking the steak (before we ever received it -- they wouldn't bring it out incorrectly) the manager came and apologized without us ever uttering a word. He gave us all free desserts and it was awesomeAother time a few weeks ago  my fianc and I went and although it was packed on a Friday nig  they told us we could sit on the heated patio ring away. We went and there was always a different server  runner  busboy  etc making sure our heater was working well. O top of that  they had gluten-free pizza (for this crazy diet I am on) and a tomato and mozzarella salad that were both to die for. SO GOOD!This time tonight  it was a little chilly so we opted to wait the 25 minutes for an indoor table. Wile we were waiting  the manager and a server came out with some pre-sliced pizza for everyone waiting. Wo has ever heard of such a thing?! Amazingly great service. Also  our waiter noticed out iPad and stopped to talk to us about his favorite apps  etc. This is no fluke here  this location is well managed. If you steer clear because of it's chain-restaurant stigma  fret-not. This place is the reason the chain exists. Well done!
Kevin A.,North Hollywood  CA,0,26,,12/31/2014,1.0,"Food arrived 45 minutes later and cold! When our waitress said ""careful hot plate"" we thought the plate was actually hot. Not so. When they offered to remake the food it returned warmed up Not remade! Ruined my evening."
Eugene G.,Los Angeles  CA,40,130,6,9/21/2013,2.0,Went on a Saturday and it was miserable. The service was slow  the receptionist looked annoyed and the food was sub-par. I would give it a one star if it wasn't for the extensive beer selection and TV at every angle.
Laura D.,Burbank  CA,75,23,,12/21/2010,4.0,I've been here a number of times and it's always been consistent on the food and service. I love their sante fe salad with grilled shrimp. I honestly have a hard time ordering anything else. It's one of those places that can be fun on game day or you can choose to be put back in a quieter corner. We've have good size groups and have had no problem getting seated. Overall it's a decent place to eat!
Nicole R.,Tujunga  CA,72,40,80,8/8/2013,5.0,Once before me and my boyfriend had gone to the one in Valencia for a night out. We loved the deep dish pizza. So when we saw that there was one in Burbank we had to try it. So we went in and we were greeted by the kind lady at the service desk. Then our waiter promptly arrived to seat us. We got seated close to the bar which is fine because it was far from the kitchen. The sound level can be a little noisy but that is to be expected at a place such as this one. So really it was no biggie! Next here comes our waiter  he asks us if we would like to order some drinks to start. seeing as we don't drink we ordered a coke and a sprite with no ice  about 5 sec. Later here comes out waiter with the drinks. He then says he will give us some time to look over the menu. We were seated about 5-10 minutes before our waiter came over and asked us if we were ready to order which we were. We ended up getting a small pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza and a side of chicken strips. Surprisingly the order arrived very quickly and was very hot. Also the food we got was just the right amount for us (2 people). So we began to chow down and our waiter comes over about 2 different times and asks how our food is. The food was really good. The pizza though is the topping on the cake  it is so delicious and piping hot I might add. So when we were finished it was almost like our waiter was watching us  because he came over and took our plates from us and offered dessert but we declined as we were going up the street to Yogurtland! Then before he got away we asked him if we could please have our check and he handed it to us. Our total was right around $27.00 which is not bad if you think about it. We got a small pizza 2 drinks and like 6 chicken strips...not bad I would say and it definitely filled us up. Our service and food was great and would definitely come back for more. Thanks Bj's.
Robert M.,Glendale  CA,304,112,54,11/9/2010,2.0,Not a big fan of the Glendale BJ's. Go to the Burbank one  much better.Wait times on busy days are terrible  parking situation is worse and for some reason food quality is worse than the Burbank  CA BJ's. I do not think i have been there once and been happy with the service we've gotten. I'm not sure why that is but something has to change!I haven't been there in a while and probably wont go back unless i'm dragged their by friends.
Vrezh G.,Valley Glen  CA,74,31,4,11/10/2013,5.0,Great customer service !! Me and my gf just went for dessert and it took alittle long for our pizookie to come out.. not so long that we complained but noticeably longer than usual.. we finishing eatting our pizookie which was perfect and the manager came by to inform us that he was sorry for the wait on our dessert .. that he covered the bill and also gave us a gift card for $10 for our next visit! Never see stuff like this anymore..im amazed by the service
CSC M.,Burbank  CA,11,139,1,11/17/2012,2.0,I was confused by our experience at this Burbank BJ's  because our experiences at the locations in Pasadena and Palmdale have always been excellent. The staff is definitely friendly and apologetic  and we had a manager taking care of us after a multitude of issues happened  but overall it's not a location we will go back to.
Dylan B.,Fresno  CA,20,23,3,5/2/2013,5.0,I felt compelled to leave a glowing review for our waitress  Rebecca (it says Rebecca 30 on the receipt). She was a shining example of an excellent waitress. Our food was awesome  too. Thanks Rebecca!
Amanda C.,Winnetka  CA,35,41,14,4/10/2013,4.0,Went there Friday night. Enjoyed sitting outdoors on a cool late night  delicious beers and deep dish pizza. Had to get the pizzookie of course. Our waitress handed my date her number when he went to the mens room. That provided us with a laugh the rest of the night!
Cindy N.,North Hollywood  CA,70,113,117,7/17/2011,3.0,"Alrighty! So I tried their new ""Grilled Steak Salad"" and I have to say it was pretty good! The waitress that we had was really great and always on her task! Recommend that salad! && of course I RECOMMEND a PAZZOOKIII!! To anyone and everyone who goes to BJ\'s!"
Barbara M.,Los Angeles  CA,66,85,12,8/3/2013,3.0,Came here to watch basketball finals! it was perfect had some steak and drinks and enjoyed the game at the same time!
Letty B.,Sylmar  CA,11,78,6,7/8/2012,1.0,FOOD POISONING.  FOOD POISONING.  FOOD POISONING.My friend and I both got food poisoning from this place last night. He ordered the meat lovers pizza and I ordered the BJ's favorite pizza. I don't know if the pizzas were undercooked or their refrigeration is inadequate or they have poor sanitation. I just know that every time I think I'm done with the toilet  I have to run back to use it again. On the plus side  I think I lost weight overnight.
Garin V.,Tujunga  CA,0,5,,3/8/2013,1.0,Came in on a Thursday night with my two cousins. Had a pretty bad experience with the food.- First  the nachos we ordered had a long hair in it. It was baked right into the cheese. The chips were soggy and it looked like it was sitting around.- My cousin had ordered the chicken plate. The chicken was also soggy.- My other cousin ordered the lamb chops which came out cold and also had soggy bean sprouts.- I ordered the chili cheeseburger with fries. Pretty much everything on my plate was soggy. Fries didn't taste good and the bun was a liquid mush.Won't be going back here again...
Jamie C.,Lubbock  TX,2,32,3,8/30/2014,2.0,It started out so well. It was 3 pm and we were seated right away  our waitress seems attentive and got our drinks and took our order within 5 minutes or so. Then everything went downhill. We don't see our waitress for 30 minutes. The salad my husband ordered finally appears at 3:35  brought out by someone other than our waitress. Baby is starting to get fussy now and a quick afternoon bite is turning ugly fast. We get water and soda refills at 3:45. Realizing this just isn't going to work  50 minutes after arriving  we ask to have our order to go. An hour after sitting down  we now have our food. Sure  the service was slow  but at least we have our food. We get home  get the baby settled down for a nap  and go to finally eat. *sigh* the disappointment continues. My burger is over cooked and missing the grilled onions advertised on the menu. Well at least my husband's wings were...oh wait...it was missing the dipping sauce. Oh BJ's  what happened?!?! Why are you so bad?!?!
ELeen A.,Glendale  CA,16,4,,12/29/2013,1.0,This place has the worst service. Bad management and crappy food. found a cockroach on our table and they did not even offer to give us a refund.
Sahina K.,Los Angeles  CA,37,114,,9/24/2011,4.0,They're doing this 2 for $20 deal that is amazing!2 salads or soup  a medium pizza  and a pazookie! So good!We ordered the mushroom and balsamic onion pizza! We got the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie! What a good deal!
Michelle P.,Los Angeles  CA,675,592,1646,7/1/2008,3.0,Overall a 3 star from me  but based on the cookie pizookie thingy - oh yum - 5 star. If you just want to chill  watch a game  have some drinks  this is a decent place. I like the large bar area. But  if you want to go somewhere just for a dessert  wowzie! I had a french connection  which was made well. But  when I asked for a Godfather  the bartender didn't know how to make it. Boo! However  this place has a nice selection of brews if you like beer.And  if you like pizza  they have great build it yourself option. Just a little on the pricey side.
John E.,West Covina  CA,0,8,,12/21/2014,1.0,Me and my wife came in on a Sunday afternoon. The hostess sat us down and we waited for our server. We waited 10 before I initiated a conversation to another waiter on how long the wait would be (after we sat at our table). We waited another 10 minutes  and still nobody had came by. The server staff/service is poor. ** mind you this is the first time we've ever walked out on a restaurant. I'm still hesitant to give it 1star.
Nancy B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,2/16/2015,1.0,"unhappy valentine""s daymy family and i went to bjs in burbank for valentines dinner.what a bad choice. we only waited 10 mins to get a table but the service was horrible. i had to wait 15 mins to get a refill on my pepsi. she kept coming to the table saying oh yes your refill oh yes your refill. she came by 3 times but never refilled it. when the server brought our food he asked can i get anything else for you. i asked for steak sauce  parmesan cheese and a spoon. he never brought it. i asked the waitress she managed to bring the steak sauce.i asked for a pizookie but the wait was too long i asked her to cancel it. she said oh we are soo busy tonight  yet she was standing at her computer most of the time. at this point if i needed anything i just got up from my chair and walked over to her. she brought the pizookie as were leaving saying its free. forget it. dinner was ruined."
Vy N.,Burbank  CA,58,61,8,5/26/2013,3.0,Food here is your average chain restaurant food  good  reasonably price and atmosphere moderately loud and and very spacious  however on one occasionI left my credit card here accidentally after paying and called to speak with the manager a couple of days later and was put on hold so decided ill head over.... It was a 12 min drive.... Arrived and went to the front desk... Unfortunately the manager was still busy on the other line... I'm waiting and waiting.....and no manager to be found. The receptionist can't do anything and only the manger has access. Its a busy evening and instead of being on the floor supervising and overseeing dinner service at the busiest time of the evening  the manger is apparently on the phone. I wasn't very please to wait for over 35 minutes to get my card. Yes it's my fault for leaving my card in the first place  but waiting for a total of 47 minutes to get my credit card is pretty ridiculous. Customer first  phone call to corporate  etc can take a minute break.
Patricia W.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,6,2,,10/19/2013,1.0,While the food was good  the service was awful. We asked the waitress to spilt the check and at the end of the night she said she forgot and we had to say what we ordered again. Also  we ordered our pizookies at 7:00 we got them at 8:30!!! That's just ridiculous!
Gem S.,North Hills  Los Angeles  CA,226,387,125,5/14/2013,4.0,In general  I enjoy BJ's. I like their food  desserts  and drinks. Most of the time  I split a customized pizza with the boyfriend then delve into a sinful pizookie thereafter. It's not the most romantic spot  as it can be pretty loud  but it's a fun spot to gather with family and friends. There are a ton of TVs so often times  the loudness originates from the patrons catching a game.
Dr. Heath U.,Redondo Beach  CA,5,82,1,12/9/2013,2.0,There is nothing special with the food. It tastes like it was mass produced in a factory in Mexico. I had a pizza  it was made incorrectly. The pizza could have been a frozen one from the supermarket and wouldn't have been able to tell. Chicken in the pasta had blood dots in it still. Clearly undercooked  thank god we didn't get sick. Service was typical  no personality  she made all the stupid suggestions  offered us a dessert that we didn't want  thanked us for coming in. I think i would prefer having a robot serve me than a typical corporate restaurant server. Don't come here expecting anything other than putting food in your mouth and leaving.
Jeff C.,Orem  UT,111,230,37,4/8/2013,3.0,Average food and drinks. It's a sports bar so can be crowded when there's a big game on. My Burger was burnt and was average. The service was average. The waitress we had missed not getting a bigger tip my not bringing us our change back. Overall I'd say we had a OK experience with OK food.
Sean S.,Burbank  CA,23,11,15,3/11/2015,4.0,Everyone knows BJ's is an excellent place to go grab a drink and enjoy some delicious food that is both crafted well and not to expensive but i will tell you why I am only giving 4 stars. I was seated in the late afternoon with two other friends a couple of days ago and granted we sat in the patio (always a difficult place for servers to get food out on time) my deep dish vegetarian pizza and chicken alfredo pasta came out kind of cold. Again i completely understand given where i was seated and the fact that the server was so sweet and dealing with other customers that were spaced out is why i think 4 stars is fair.I HAVE to reiterate how good this girl was  i wish i could remember her name so i could ask for her next time i come in! In conclusion i enjoyed my meal  the steak that my friend got was also delicious and not cold whatsoever (medium rare i might add) but yes i would recommend anyone to go to BJ's in burbank if they never have (which honestly i would not understand why someone needs to read this review to understand how good BJ'S is) overall awesome experience and cant wait till i am old enough to enjoy the drinks they have available (and maybe not sit at the patio) last but not least PAZOOKI FOR THE WIN if you don't know what that is.......then i give up hahah
Sandy S.,Arleta  CA,98,248,542,5/1/2011,4.0,I had the Sesame Chicken Salad  Chicken Pesto Flatbread  Glazed Caramelized Chicken  and the Pazookie. My other friends had ordered the Cheese deep dish pizza and the fires and it cam out way before our dishes. So we waited patiently for our food to come. When it finally came  it was delicious and flavorful but I have to say I waited a LONG time for the food (and so did my friends at the whole table). I was a little disappointed that it took a long time and some of the food was already cold. I also waited a good 30 minutes for the pazookie and the kids at my table were falling asleep.
Luke W.,San Luis Obispo  CA,1017,945,1418,10/12/2008,4.0,So we show up around 10:30pm  which is usually the wrong time to show up to a resturant around town as most places are looking to close down around 11pm. Well....not BJ's.I was hanging out with some friends and we wanted a place for some good beer and food. BJ's was recommended. Wow.What a cool menu. Too bad I had eaten dinner a around 7pm. I could have had a field day with their sandwiches and and various grilled BBQ'q items.But alas  I had to try something. So I went for the $8.95 Nachos.Wow. I can usually put away some nachos and beer  but I barely made it halfway through.I had a few different beers. All excellent.My friends had the most amazing looking pizza.And it wasn't until about 1am that we were told last drink and food orders needed to be places. Too cool.Nice service  friends waiters  good food  great beer.A chain? Yes. but who cares when its really good?I am a fan and will be back.Check it out. Lunch  dinner  or just some good drinks. Though I don't drink mixed drinks  they had a good selection and it can serve quite a varied palate of drink and food desires.Check it out.Can't wait to go back.
Ara K.,Los Angeles  CA,2,31,7,11/27/2012,2.0,Eh. I've had worse. But the hostess thinks she's working as a door girl at a hot night club. Servers could pretend a little harder that they care. Not worth it.
Scott R.,Sherman Oaks  Los Angeles  CA,3,93,29,5/20/2013,3.0,Had chilli and a salad - salad was plain no biggie. The chilli was good  nice kick but would have been nice to have some bread . Server was good for our party of 6  she kept asking me if I want more salad and chilli  she might want to have explained to me it was included  I had no clue. The light shades over our table were filthy  dust was caked all around  might want to clean a bit!!!
Dorothy L.,Los Angeles  CA,849,422,753,8/30/2010,4.0,I love beer  but I just cannot seem to like any of the BJ's brews... I try  and try  and tryyy to like even the blonde  or the red  but they're just not wonderful. BUT BJ's may have the best happy hour food of all time. That is the sole reason it is a staple happy hour place for me and my sports-loving boyfriend. We love to stake out spots during NBA Finals or MNF or just a regular old Wednesday after work. We think BJ's has the best chicken wings around. To accompany those amazing wings  we vary between a mini favorite pizza  nachos  or my new fav on HH - pork sliders. (You GOTTA try those - with the pulled pork and onion ring strings... OOH WEE!) I also love that their HH goes until 7:00 p.m. weekdays. It can get pretty crowded sometimes  but just try to get there ASAP before 7  and you should have a wonderful experience!
Martha L.,Alhambra  Los Angeles  CA,0,10,4,1/2/2014,4.0,The order was late  but the server (not her fault) made up for it with no charge for 2 N/A drinks and 3 free mini pazokies! The food was delicious  we had a great lunch!
Daniel L. d.,San Leandro  CA,127,26,23,1/24/2011,5.0,One luv!!! 5 OralesOne of the best time ever. Came to vist my brother from the San Fransisco. We walked in to the bar. There was only one seat at the bar. I jumped in it to wait around for more seats  there was 3 of us. The couple next to us told us they will move down so we had 2 seats. After we order our drinks the bartender came around and brought another seat for my brother. Front row in the middle at the bar with 6 tv screens to watch. COuld not ask for a better time.BJ brownie is OFF THE CHAIN.
Nicholas B.,Pomona  CA,101,233,38,3/27/2013,3.0,Its a BJ's If you have been to one you have been to them all. There really isn't anything too special about this place. The service was good  there is a lot of seating  and the wait is long.
Ryan C.,Los Angeles  CA,31,33,,7/23/2013,2.0,Our server was overly chatty. Good at his job but we felt awkward at times. We ordered three appetizers and were unimpressed with all of them. The sauce in the avocado roles was watered down  the calamari was lukewarm and soggy  and the shrimp rolls were not anything special at all. Not worth the calories or money  I'm not ready to rule out BJ's quite yet as I've enjoyed their chain in the past just not sure if I'll try the one in Burbank again.
Bea B.,Burbank  CA,52,53,12,5/14/2011,3.0,Went here with a big group for lunch to watch the Celtics/Heat game on a Sunday. Crowd was alright. They were pretty nice considering our group was the loudest. Half Celtics-Half Heat.They don't turn up the volume for the game though  but it's cool you don't really need to hear the commentators.Food was meh. They have Stella Artois which pleased me but no Blue Moon.Parking: I'm not sure why there's a need for valet but I'm not going to avail of that for $5. I can park my car in the structure and walk two flights of stairs.
Adam J.,Los Angeles  CA,5,47,10,8/23/2014,2.0,Service was ridiculously slow. it took 30 minutes to see our server. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out. And it took another 20 minutes till someone came for us to ask for the check.
Lyndsey P.,Burbank  CA,2,15,2,6/22/2012,5.0,One of my absolute fav places to go  if not my fav. Very hard to get into on a game night. Couldn't get a seat until around 10 PM but it is still worth it. They are always busy  so if you want immediate seating it's best to go at odd hours or later in the evening  or bring something to read or do while you wait. The whole menu has great food options  I haven't had a dish I don't like.
Iska B.,Los Angeles  CA,153,521,35,3/4/2011,4.0,"Not at all bad for a chain! Seriously! Maybe it\'s just my memory of the beer sampler talking  but I genuinely enjoyed myself here!If you like beer  it is absolutely worth a try  even if you\'re a big food snob and you never go to chains.They brew their own beer and the samplers are very fun and quite good. There is sure to be one you\'ll want to try and they\'re generous with their sample sizes too (think cups not shot glasses). I went for the wheat beer sampler but there are many more to choose from or else just get a pitcher of your favorite brew. I did actually eat something (ha) and that was quite nice as well. I ended up going with the Italian Market Salad which was really big and they didn\'t skimp on the ingredients. I loathe when a restaurant serves me a salad and it\'s mostly iceberg lettuce with one tomato and one olive. Not so here. This is a great and filling salad that tasted really fresh and was covered in delicious olives and fresh mozzarella cheese plus artichokes and other veggies. I found it to be very filling which was also a pleasant surprise.Despite all this food and beer there was also room left for dessert so we gave their infamous ""Pizookie"" a try. Stupid as the name is  this thing is quite tasty. It\'s basically a freshly baked cookie sitting in a deep dish like a pizza and topped with ice cream. It\'s deliciously soft (I HATE hard baked cookies) to boot. You can\'t go wrong with this thing. Trust me.All in all this is a satisfying chain restaurant. I\'m definitely liking it a lot more than other similar counterparts (Chilis  TGIFriday\'s etc.) and I\'d definitely come back to try more beers."
Eric Z.,Studio City  CA,1,26,,11/22/2014,4.0,Pizza is good  but they have by far the best Hef you will find anywhere.
Lawrence T.,Honolulu  HI,0,66,,11/2/2011,4.0,We were first seated by the hostess at the darkest table in the restaurant. So dark  we could hardly read the menu - and it's not like we're senior citizens! Asked our waiter if we could move  and it was no problem. In fact  he gave us outstanding service the whole time we were there  answering our questions deftly  meeting our needs  and making great suggestions.The place is huge  and so is the menu. We started with the nachos and just about ate the whole thing between the two of us. Not that it was small  but we were hungry and they were good. Crispy chips  real cheese  and a bed of tasty chili.We also had a pizza  which our great waiter told us could be done half-half. We got half portobello mushroom and half combination  both of which were delicious.For dessert  we were also informed that the pazooki can be done half-half  so we got half peanut butter and half triple chocolate. Great complimentary flavors.I'd definitely come back. Just watch out for the dark table.
Benito L.,Los Angeles  CA,511,291,12,1/2/2011,3.0,For a pretty mediocre place  I don't understand why people constantly flock to this restaurant/brewery day in and day out. No wait  yes I do....PIZOOKIE!!!! :)
Bernadette S.,Covina  CA,63,4,,4/20/2012,1.0,Haven't been here in a long time  last time we had the worst service. Decided to give it a try 1 more time because we love the food but once again we got crappy service. The waiter has a really bad attitude  he seems bothered just to bring us drinks. Will not ever come back to this BJs
Tiffany H.,Embarcadero  San Francisco  CA,0,1,,11/15/2014,2.0,I hope our server  Katherine S.  has a better day tomorrow than she did today. A smile  eye contact and some personality would have made the long wait for our food more tolerable. Having been to this BJ's many  many times before  this was uncharacteristic of this location. We were expecting more than overcooked pasta and no pizza to-go boxes on a slow Saturday afternoon. Because this was unusual we'll most likely be back  but hopefully next time our review will have more stars and less complaining.
Ed S.,Studio City  CA,6,26,,10/26/2012,1.0,I normally love BJ's  as the pizzas  wings  and pizzokie usually doesn't disappoint. But this Burbank location provided the worst experience that I've ever had in terms of quality of food - I would've gotten better food digging through a trash dumpster behind any of the other restaurants in Burbank.I visited this location a couple Saturday ago with my wife  and decided to order wings  pizza  and a pizookie. The wings were delicious as always  but that's where the fun stopped. The pizza was undercooked by a significant margin and all I could taste was dough. I asked for a replacement  and the replacement took over half an hour to get  which wasn't the worst of it. This time they overcooked the pizza and made it into a hard  crunchy cookie that I could have easily thrown through a brick wall. And just when I thought the meal couldn't get any worse  out came this undercooked pizookie that was nothing more than raw cookie dough covered with ice cream. All in all  a pathetic effort by this Burbank location. There are a lot of better restaurants in that area that will serve better food  I suggest you go to one of those.
Jamie R.,Corona  CA,100,45,20,3/21/2011,5.0,This gets 5 stars purely for their customer service. Their food is great...My mom had a turkey burger (huge)  my grandma had the pot roast (she said it was tastey...and she's very picky) and I had the fried shrimp (yummy!).We were promptly seated  and immediately greeted by our waiter. He was very efficient  being sure to not let our drinks go empty or napkins run out. And we even had the manager check on us multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed. Great experience!
Annette M.,Anaheim  CA,6,53,86,4/11/2011,4.0,4.0 service...4.5 food...I've been to the Bj's over in Brea several times and the food is always delicious and always busy... this was my first time at this location and everyone was polite and courteous upon arriving.. parking valet was like $4 but there was a two level mini lot there and we just wanted to save some money and parked.The greeter immediately had us seated and the server was attentive and informative. Had the best beginning.. great appetizer dish accompanied with the strawberry confusion and long island iced tea... was too full to eat anything even their signature cookie and ice cream concoction... pizookie ): perhaps next time..
Molly A.,San Fernando Valley  CA,73,57,934,12/3/2010,3.0,Turkey Club  Lasagna  and Avocado Rolls are my favorites...
Marie D.,Whittier  CA,0,2,2,11/7/2014,1.0,Horrible service called before arriving to ask for estimated wait time and they said 15 mins after arriving they told us it was 35 mins the hostess chelsey was really rude and made me feel like I was lying about calling when they had my name! They made us feel very humiliated and kept looking at us wrong they also had us move rudely when the place was crowded and there was no where to go go. Never coming back!!
Jonathan P.,Los Angeles  CA,448,184,91,2/17/2011,4.0,I often frequent this BJ's. The parking here kind of sucks  very limited. And then they make up for it by having valet.I'm sorry  but I don't feel like BJ's should be one of those places that you should valet for.Parking aside  the service and food here has always been good.The bartenders are always fast  friendly and professional.As always  Great White  Buffalo Wings and Piranha Pale Ale for me!Pizookie if I'm feeling extra glutinous.
Jenny J.,Los Angeles  CA,90,126,66,9/2/2010,3.0,ok. We came here for dessert. I don't regret it but wish the waiter was different.So heres the rundown:We walk in. Got seated.7 minutes passed by.Waiter arrives with the menu.. Woot!(now the boys are having fun playing with the salt and pepper shaker and trying to stab each other with the butter knife)10 minutes passed by he finally came and took our order.We got the pizookie trio  apple and oats  cookies and cream.20 minutes passed by and our dishes arrive YAY!!!yum yum delicious something I would RECOMMEND!!!!OK. NOW WHERE THE HELL IS OUR WAITER!?!?!?10 minutes passed by... 5 minutes passed by. screw it. I managed to flag down another waitress and had her bring our check. lala.. i gave her the money before she left to stop any other delay. 5 minutes passed.. another 5 minutes she stops and she looks at us and says that our waiter was going to bring it..5 minutes later.. the manager stops by asking us if we want anything else and i told him I WANT MY CHANGE.Finally got it  left a 2 dollar tip and left very pissed and annoyed.
Kyle S.,Burbank  CA,368,348,101,9/7/2010,2.0,HANDS DOWN  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF EXPERIENCING. THE NIGHT MANAGER IS A JOKE.TO SUM IT UP....PROS:-Big portions-Great food-Decent pricesCONS:-HORRIBLE  RUDE & SLOW service-It gets VERY crowded VERY quickly-Parking is awkward.
Erica F.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,,6/29/2012,2.0,Sooo i recently went with a few friends and and somehow they managed to send our pizza to the wrong table  so then we had to get a new one  only for it to be dropped on the way out. then they tried to charge us for large pazookies when we clearly ordered small ones. Besides those kinks food was okay and our server was funny.
Jasmin A.,Sun Valley  CA,171,36,3,2/17/2010,1.0,Bad service. periodI went there on a Monday to have an early dinner . The waitress served us our food  but disappeared for most of the evening. The restaurant was not even packed for being a long weekend  so there was really no excuse for her not to check up on us. She never came by to refill my soda; not once. Our appitizer was served twice for some reason  but we shun away the second. We saw her from a distance chatting it up with other waiters most of the time and sitting down to socialize with other customers. We left disappointed at the service and gave her a tip that she deserved. BJ's just lost 2 customers after that stunt
Jen T.,Los Angeles  CA,313,770,58,8/26/2012,2.0,The good thing about this location is that it's a lot bigger than other BJ's  but there's a mandatory valet parking fee. So just be warned when you come here that if you want to park in their lot  you have to valet for $3.50 on a friday night. Not sure about other nights...
Tom A.,Burbank  CA,7,49,8,5/28/2013,5.0,I don't really give out 5 stars ever and yes it's a chain   but I have to say my wife and I went last night and ate in bar area   no waiting  and I had the rib eye she had the sirloin steak we realize this is not a high end steak house but the prices aren't also  but wow it tasted like one   both med rare cooked perfectly ! And mine 20 bucks hers 17. Really! With a wedge salad and other sides amazing! And the beer selection and quality is awesome and the staff was super nice and it was at the busiest time of night ! Well done and that's why 5 stars for this type of restaurant its top of its class.
monica m.,Covina  CA,97,14,4,6/15/2012,1.0,This place has the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to!!! My group had a table n it was faster to go to the bar n get our order..our waitress never came to see if we needed drinks not until I asked to speak to a manager did we finally get a waiter to come ask us about drinks (n even then it took 20 mind n they were wrong)....we ordered a moscatto n got the giraffe no wine glass..so I asked for a glass they never came back...I had to go to the bar for glass...they get one star because that's the least I cam give them!! This place get a minus -0 for service...even the manager sucked!!
Chanda D.,Los Angeles  CA,146,54,13,2/11/2010,5.0,"I love BJ\'s so much that I unabashedly proclaim ""I love BJ\'s!""  even though I know it sounds like I\'m talking about blowiez. Rarely do I frequent the same restaurant more than once/month because of all the oodles of choices in LA  but my first visit was a month ago and I\'ve been there twice since.The pints of delicious hand-crafted beers are well-priced at $5 (the blonde is my fave - so crisp  clean  and smooth!)  but is an even better price during the 10pm-close happy hour  during which time they\'re only $4. Our knowledgeable waiter Chris suggested we get the pitcher  which was $14.95  cheaper than four beers at even the happy hour price - smart boy!I always get the veggie deep-dish pizza  which is great  but what\'s even better is that the personal size is half price  about $5  during the happy hour. Note: happy hour is only at the bar tables.I\'ve never had a bad experience at BJ\'s. In fact  when I looked around at the tables last night  everyone looked as joyous as if they were in a Dave and Buster\'s commercial.There was a coupon on the bottom of my receipt that promised a code to get free mozz stix to complete a survey  so complete it I did. I expected 3 stix  maybe 4  but the order was a full 10 stix!I love you  BJ\'s!!!"
Scott D.,Los Angeles  CA,117,55,28,1/23/2011,3.0,The servers don't know anything about the gluten free menu. You can't show them either because the iPhone won't bring up the Internet only the m.Internet. Stupid smart phone  even more stupid servers. Oh  the home brew beer is awesome.
Brittany B.,Santa Clarita  CA,0,10,3,5/3/2014,2.0,Not my best experiences I've been so other bjs and they are great but this one made me so displease he spilled my drink and did not offer to get another. No Silverware was provided till asked while eating. We had to send back three dishes for wrong food  under cooked food  and over cooked food. One of our dishes was still not cooked properly after sending it back. The manger was fack and did not offer to comp any of it till we requested it. Then messed up the comp sad. Our waiter was at lest understanding and sweet. All in all bad experiences I'm glad it's not my first cause I would not go back
Hannah M.,SUNLAND  CA,3,5,,9/20/2014,5.0,Always satisfied with BJ's food and service! Everything I have ever tried there has been great. But I always get their crispy fried artichoke  they are soo amazing!
Youbi K.,Burbank  CA,56,60,13,5/12/2013,4.0,Went on a friday night with 3 other friends  got seated quickly  friendly service  and clean  tasty food. What more to ask for?
Angie C.,Mountain View  CA,43,152,1,3/6/2012,1.0,I went to another BJ's Brewhouse in northern California this weekend that made me recall the absolutely HORRIBLE service from the Burbank BJ's. When I relayed the story to my friend  she advised me to share it on Yelp as well.1st horrible experience:I threw a surprise party for a friend. I made the arrangements with the general manager three weeks in advance  down to the last detail including that there would be multiple checks  the party guests would need to be seated immediately even if the entire party wasn't yet there (it was a surprise  after all)  and that I'd be bringing a cake/candles for the birthday girl.The morning of (Saturday in September 2010)  I brought in the cake and candles and confirmed all the details with the host staff and management. Everything went smoothly for about an hour  and then things fell apart. It took more than two hours to split the checks  even though I'd offered from the start to help the servers divide them up and keep them separate. During those two hours  NO ONE came to check on us. Plenty of people wanted dessert and alcoholic drinks  but we couldn't even get anyone to bring water. I asked the server THREE TIMES for the cake. When she finally brought it out  she plunked it down in front of me (still in the box with the candles in a bag on top) and walked away.The most frustrating part was talking to management as this was happening. I was mortified that my guests were unable to leave whenever they felt like it because they didn't want to stick me with their bills. We were all stuck there for several hours with no drinks  no snacks  and no birthday celebration despite it all having been arranged in advance. When I pointed this out to management  he repeatedly apologized. Nothing more. I finally had to ASK what steps were being taken to fix the problem  and what they planned on doing to compensate us for the ruined party. After about 4 hours in the restaurant  we finally had an acceptable solution and got to leave. I was satisfied with the resolution and even came back a couple times (with non-memorable experiences) until my next horrible experience.2nd horrible experience:This time  it was MY birthday. I was stuck at work  but wanted a to-go lunch from BJ's. I called in the order and left to pick it up. The problem with this restaurant is really the parking layout and the valet service. When I pulled into the parking lot  the valets had parked cars in all the to-go spaces. The valets directed me to a non-existent spot at the back of the lot  and I had to circle the block and re-enter the lot. Then the valets directed me to a second non-existent space. I circled the block again. The third time  I was getting pretty pissed. The valets told me to park in the handicapped spot. I told them no. They told me it was the only way I'd be able to get in at the moment  and that they did it all the time with no problems. I told them they'd be responsible for paying for any parking tickets and parked  furious. Sure enough  a driver who actually had handicapped placards stopped me and asked why I'd parked there. Frustrated  I explained to her that the valets had told me to do it  and all I wanted to do was get my damn lunch. Wouldn't you know it  that lady called the police on the valets? Apparently she was a regular at this BJ's and was tired of the valets taking up to-go spaces and then telling to-go orderers to park in the handicapped spots (how does this become standard operating procedure?!). The valet rushed in after me  grabbed my keys  and reparked my car before the police arrived. When I mentioned what just happened to management  and the fact that this was two horrible experience related to birthdays in just a few months  I got a very nonchalant apology. I had to chase corporate customer service for MONTHS to get a response. I wound up getting a gift card for the aggravation  which I promptly used at a DIFFERENT BJ's location.I will never be returning to this one again.
Ru K.,Woodland Hills  CA,0,1,,10/16/2014,5.0,My friends and I come all the time for happy hour. It's a pretty good deal and then we always get a pizookie...which is to die for! We had Brittany for the first time and she was awesome. Went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. She was funny and had us laughing with almost every encounter. Going to go in again for sure. Wish all BJs had this kind of friendly staff.
Lisa F.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,51,9,,6/19/2012,4.0,"I was concerned coming in on Father\'s Day without a reservation  but was very happy to be sat within minutes! Our server Claudia  was amazing!! She was quick to greet us and made sure our toddler\'s meal was ordered at the same time as our appetizers. The buffalo wings are a favorite! For our meals  my husband ordered the pork sliders (which he loved) and I tried the mahi mahi. The mahi mahi was good  slightly bland  but I added a bit of chili paste that was painted on my plate for a bit of flavor. Of course you cannot leave without trying a pizookie for dessert!! Our favorite by far is the Oreo pizookie! They also offer a trio plate which is nice to share and you can pick a variety of flavors to try at once. Our server also gave each of us ""Father\'s Day"" pilsner glasses to take home for coming in Father\'s Day weekend! We will definitely be back for the food and especially the service!"
Stephanie A.,North Hollywood  CA,2,46,,6/8/2013,5.0,I love BJ'S!!!!!! Everything is good here the bbq pizza  their lettuce wraps  Jambalaya... & i absolutely love their PIZOOKIE!!!!! If you want to enjoy delicious food come here!
lindsey a.,Los Angeles  CA,1,28,4,2/16/2012,2.0,I LOVE the food here but this location is the WORST. It's close to my house  so it's convenient but I'd definitely rather go to the Glendale location  and here's why:-The first time I went here  we were seated and our sever never showed up to our table. When I say never  I mean never. We waited for 30 min since it was busy  and then called over a random server to see what was up. She said she'd find our server and send them over. Didn't happen. We called her over again and she ended up taking our order out of pity  even though she was slammed. Naturally  the service sucked since we weren't her table. We never met our real server.-One time  we were sitting in the back and a COCKROACH ran across the wall. I freaked out and got up. The manager came over and said he couldn't see it but asked us if we wanted to move (Um  no  I want to stay and dine with it...?). He placed us a few seats over which wasn't really far enough. I was sketched out the rest of the meal. We could see out of the window that the dumpster was close to the booth we were sitting in  so that's definitely where it came from.-Another time  when eating the spinach artichoke dip  I bit down on a huge chunk of GLASS! We could see that the dish the artichoke dip was in was cracked and missing a big piece  about the size of a quarter . The piece was now in my mouth. The waiter didn't seem too worried. He kind of apologized and took it away. He didn't replace it  even though we were only half done. He ended up giving us the appetizer for free but that's all. Now  I'm not one to expect free stuff from places but I felt like this matter should have been handled a bit better. For all they knew  I could have cut myself or went home and filed a lawsuit. They treated it like I complained that the dish was cold or something. Every other time I've been here the service has been super sketch. So why do I keep going back??! Because I am obsessed with their BBQ Chicken Salad!! It's my favorite salad ever. Their food is always good. I've never had anything bad from BJ's (except service). Their beer is amazing too.**Oh and a little tip: When you pull up  there's a valet man who wants to take your car. Valet is optional!! Just tell him you want to self park and drive 3 feet forward into the lot. Most everyone thinks you have to valet so they pay money to have this man pull your car up a foot and park it. Unless you're the laziest person in the world  save your $3.50 and park it yourself.  After the glass incident  I switched to the Glendale location and haven't had any more problems.
Jose L.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,2/23/2014,1.0,Pretty bad . Got there for my friends bday and they told me he was I was cut off because the birthday boy was too drunk. He left at least 5 mins after I came in.
Stacie Y.,Buffalo  NY,11,82,49,9/19/2012,3.0,Has a great choices on the gluten free menu  and the tortilla soup was very good. Service was good  nothing spectacular.
Byron A.,VALLEY VILLAGE  CA,41,131,17,11/13/2012,4.0,There are a lot of negative reviews about the service here. When I came our service was pretty good. Waitress was attentive and our food was brought out promptly. Food is like any other BJ's. I'd go back if I'm shopping at this mall again.
Kaili C.,Arnold  MO,4,205,30,9/13/2013,2.0,Their piizookie cookie is wayy too sweet  overall their menu changes for the better  lighter and cheaper.  Better than apple bees.
Tina N.,Los Angeles  CA,2228,325,1242,2/28/2010,3.0,PIZOOKIE!The only reason why i come in to this restaurant is for the amazing corse salad they give with BLUE CHEESE  and the STUFFED Chili Potato! YUM! + Party Size PIZOOKIE with Brownie and ICE CREAM to top it off! HEAVEN!Thats it  no other reason! Thank you  please come again! Oh by the way  service needs to get better. Front hostess was really mean and rude. FIRE that guy  no tip for him!C+5 Stars
Topanga S.,Los Angeles  CA,15,251,2,3/4/2012,2.0,This place used to be so packed now it's dead. I guess Yard House beat it.
S E.,Mission Viejo  CA,2,14,7,12/2/2011,1.0,Ive been to plenty different BJs but this was my first time here. It was horrible. Seriously--take the time to find a different one and drive there. My server was Rebecca and she was very nice. I ordered a classic baked potato  added cheese and bacon for about an extra $2. The potato came out and it was not even warm  the cheese was not melted as it usually is  they forgot to bring butter  and they forgot green onions. They made me another one  which I ate  but it was also not warm and they still forgot the green onions. Oh and they were both stale. Considering they brought them both out within like 2 minutes of ordering them  I'mguessing they were old. I'm usually excited when my food comes out fast  but that was not the case this time. Then I got an Oreo pizookie  which at any other BJs is the best dessert ever. Not here. It was extremely doughy. So undercooked. Oh  and  they were not generous with the ice cream. I didn't eat it. I am so disappointed with my experience here. I do not recommend it. Service was good  but the food was terrible...and what's a restaurant without good food ?
Sabrina F.,Los Angeles  CA,77,249,81,11/2/2012,4.0,For a Saturday night the wait was not too long. We were seated and serviced with a smile. Our food was prompt and delicious. Our waiter was friendly and quick. We will come here again.
Ms I.,Los Angeles  CA,43,149,,12/27/2012,4.0,I'd give BJs a 5-star rating  but the last time I went there to eat with a client  the food was sub par and the waitress had an attitude problem. Usually  when we go in they know me and come over and chat. Most of the wait staff is fun and super nice  but not this waitress we had (an older African American woman). The food is excellent and I love the variety of beers. I like the giant baked potato and the wedge salad. Save room for the Pazookie (the giant cookie with ice cream). I always forget and get stuff  even thought they have miniature versions. Fun place to go with friends. I was actually taken here for my bday this year and the waiter didn't sing (we tried to make him)  but he did bring me and my crew a Pazookie.
Kyle D.,Los Angeles  CA,1,14,,7/9/2013,5.0,This place has better Deep-Dish Pizza than any Pizza place! And don't get me started on how awesome the rest of their Menu is! They've got great service  a full bar and televised sports. Take my advice...eat here! To heck with the review. WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?! GO EAT! You'll thank me! I'd love to finish this but a Pizookie is calling my name.
CD B.,Corrales  NM,0,9,,6/26/2013,4.0,Did not disappoint in the least. Very consistent with other locations in food & drink quality as well as service. Good value for the money.
Leonard S.,Palmdale  CA,48,95,265,10/22/2011,1.0,After 1:30 hr wait they sat us down next to a bunch of drunk ass fools. We asked the waiter to sit us in a different spot but they told us we would have to wait another 45 mins or told us we can leave. So I decided to say Fuck this BJ's. We left and told them off.... It's been over three years & I still haven't gone back!!!!
Rodene R.,London  United Kingdom,100,218,36,9/5/2010,3.0,Their pizzas are okay  but their PIZOOKIES are the only reason why I'd ever visit. Must try their regular warm  chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla ice cream!!! They have the triple chocolate pizookie made with Ghirardelli - soooo delicious!!! I love all of the flavors EXCEPT oatmeal.If you do go here  might as well try their PIZOOKIE TRIO!
Matt W.,Wilmington  NC,644,295,17,8/10/2012,4.0,Love their salads (my wife's favorite salad)  buffalo chix pizza and pizooki dessert
Brice S.,Portland  OR,19,13,9,1/25/2011,5.0,"Always a friendly staff. Every time I\'ve been here they\'ve been on the ball  but that is when it\'s just me and my girlfriend. When the people in my party start to multiply  then the service dies down and gets lacking.The food is always top notch and delicious.Their weekend brunch menu is awesome (gluten free breakfast pizza is a favorite). The portions are big and the beer is crisp and cold. There is a massive tv over the main bar  and many different smaller nice tvs all around. Never had any problem asking for them to be changed to a specific game.Bear in mind  I don\'t think this place is a ""sports bar"" but more of a restaurant that happens to keep sports on when it\'s on. Actually  I am thinking about their beer right now... and it\'s only 11:30am...!"
David T.,Burbank  CA,78,327,5,7/30/2010,3.0,The food and dessert (pizookie) here are really good. I was very satisfied in that regard.The worst part here is the parking situation. This is probably the only restaurant I can think of in Burbank that requires valet parking. I guess you can walk a few blocks from one of the parking garages if you don't want to pay a valet  but who wants to do that?Also  as for the service  once we were helped  everything was fine. The problem with my last experience here was that after we were seated  it took over 20 minutes for us to get served! Fortunately  a waiter who normally was not assigned our table saw us waiting and took care of us. So the service was not terrible  but we should not have had to wait as long as we did.I only hope that this place does not fall to the level of bad service that many other restaurants have in the year 2010.
Heather H.,Glendale  CA,248,139,263,9/12/2010,4.0,Quick service  friendly staff. :o) Pizookie's are awesome  I suggest the mini's unless you have a friend of two to help you eat one. :oP So is the Berry Blast Cider (21+). Parking isn't all that great  not a lot of spaces due to Valet. I parked across the street with no problems.
Brian T.,Los Angeles  CA,82,49,,11/15/2010,2.0,"Only been to this location once and it wasn\'t that great.Host was an amateur. Told us 15-20 minutes and we waited over 45 minutes for a table for 2. I understand that it was a busy night but anyone who has ever been a host before should know that you always overestimate the time if you\'re unsure or if it\'s busy (especially on a game night). If they had told us 30 minutes for a table we would have gone elsewhere since we were on somewhat of a time schedule. But having invested over 20 minutes it was too late for us to move to a different restaurant.Our server was also not so great. Since we waited 45 minutes we had already decided on our order so as soon as the server came we were ready to order. I told her so and she gave us this look like ""wtf I only wanted drink orders from you."" She took drinks and food orders from us and then left without a word. No ""thank you "" no smile  nothing. She just turned around and left and I was still holding our menus for her to take. Way to ignore me. She never did take those menus  they sat at the table until we left. She wasn\'t the most prompt server either. Even if she was insanely busy and having the worst night of her life  I would have been happy with at least a smile. Terrible service.Food and drinks were fine though.I\'ve been working in the food industry for over 10 years and this place utterly fails in the front of house. Someone should send those kids back into training."
Jerry V.,Bullhead City  AZ,33,91,,11/6/2012,2.0,Service sucks. The beer is good and the food is OK.  The walk to our house has us coming back. We go for the Tuesday 50% wine and appetizers. Would never go at full price. Too many other good places for that kind of money.
Sara R.,Dallas  TX,109,276,,6/19/2010,4.0,You only come to BJ's for Happy Hour. If you don't  then no wonder you're not happy.Happy Hour yields 50% off of their mini pizzas (so it ends up being about $5)  $2 off of the other apps  and $1 off of their draft beers - and I think the wine  too. Not the best deal  beer-wise  but the deal on the food before 7pm on weekdays  makes up for it.Happy Hour is only reedemable if you sit at the bar  or the tables in the middle section of the bar area. NOT the booths surrounding the bar. Lame. You get a good dose of sports  sporting updates  and more sports with the many TVs along the perimeter. The food. It's good. Especially their pulled pork sliders. Some of the best pulled pork I've had! I got the angus sliders last night  and although they're good  the meat is not thick enough to make me vouch for them. The mini pizzas are great. Very fluffy crust.. loads of cheese  good amount of meat  and limited veggies. Well  if you get the veggie one  I'm sure it would alter that ratio. I got the Southwestern one  and it was just ok. I wouldn't get it again. I've had the buffalo chicken pizza  and that's royal. I've also had the Great White (a long time ago)  but remember it as being pretty freakin good. I mean  alfredo sauce? That has no option to be bad.They don't have your typical beers.. draft or bottle.. i.e. Miller/Lite  Bud/Lite  Heineken  etc. Alas  it's a brewery. I haven't had their beer in awhile  but I believe it was good. It was the blonde beer (the lightest one they have).The place is clean  good atmosphere  and the service is an A! They messed up my order a bit  but that's not the wait staff fault. And I won't blame the cooks  because they're working on a Friday evening and we're getting to enjoy ours. Slack. Cut. Oh  their wedge salad. Holy *#@$&(@#&$(#*@&$(*#$&. That's all I'll say.
Raymond N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,1,7/3/2015,2.0,Will say this. Been to this location a few times and food is always good and service is good as well kinda slow at times but over all good. Went in tonight 6-2-15 and went into the men's restroom to wash my hands before dinner. The bathroom was a mess water everywhere and used hand tissue all over trash over flowing. I informed the host a young lady who acted like I was a bother and told me we will get it cleaned. During dinner I excused myself to once again visit the restroom and the place was still a mess nothing was cleaned. When I walked out I saw who I believed to be the manager a tall guy and told him about it and again he looked at me like I was being a bother. When dinner was over my friend who I was dining with excused himself walked into the bathroom and couldn't believe how messy it was. He thought I was making it up. I'm sorry 3 different times in that bathroom and you couldn't clean it. Again over all food is good but keep up with your cleanliness cause stuff like that makes me wonder how you keep other parts of your restaurant.
Cliff M.,Lynwood  CA,3,1,,5/13/2013,1.0,called ahead they said it was a 20 min wait. Then I got there in less than 3 mins and they said it was an hour wait. I got upset  then I was standing there and another customer called they told that person the samething 20min. I guess they really want to make business. Lol (Wish they were honest) after that... waiter/waitress forgot a few things.. never saw it... I been to other BJs and there much more polite ;) I did not have a very good experience.
Tim S.,Burbank  CA,42,25,1,9/16/2010,3.0,Really cool sports bar atmosphere with an extensive menu. Better than bar food but not by much. I do enjoy their brews especially the dark beers. I've had problems with service in the past but not into the last few visits. Don't try the pizza. Its more like garlic cheesy bread than pizza. Where's the sauce? And don't you dare call their pizza deep dish. Its nothing like Chicago style deep dish. Dress warm because these guys keep the temp around 60. It's always freezing in here!
Renee P.,South El Monte  CA,15,15,,9/28/2011,1.0,I ordered $14 ahi tuna salad  think it was an appetitizer  it only had three thinly sliced ahi and 1/4 of avacado  it was pittiful  nothing like the picture shown  so i politely mention to the waiter  upon returning he said the chef apologize for not putting enough lettuce (garnish) at the bottom of the mound to make it taller and fuller like the picture. At that point i didn't want to talk to them anymore  decided to just keep my peace and never to return. I've never felt so ripped off by a restaurant lol.
Michelle R.,Burbank  CA,1,2,,6/16/2015,1.0,I went to BJ's in Burbank with a friend. The service was awful our waiter seemed like he was stoned out of his mind. When it came to paying the bill I want to use my points that I have from catering all of my business meetings  which totaled 592. They told me I had no points and I have never used them. They went on to say they could nothing about the points but would give us half off of the bill. Well I checked my bank account and they charged the full bill  but the charged slip I signed was for half the bill. So not only did they lie about it they had me sign charge receipt with a different amount then what they charged. Now all this was done by the manager because as I said the waiter was too stoned to know what was going on. So this is one of two things or maybe both; fraud  or they have no idea what they are doing  or both. I will never eat there again and I definitely will never use them for our meetings. They have lost a very good customer. Good Bye
Leanne P.,Burbank  CA,140,39,8,10/23/2009,4.0,I've been a BJs regular for  um... decades  I guess  beginning with the one on the Balboa Peninsula. So I appreciated that when they went corporate  at least they were nice enough to open a location near home. The food here is good  and there's something for everybody. My personal favorite is the Angel Hair Toscana pasta (get it with grilled chicken)  which gives me enough leftovers for another meal the next day. Salads are good pretty much across the board. The thin-crust appetizer pizzas are awesome. I'm not a huge deep-dish fan  but I still splurge once in a while. The bartenders  by the way  mix a terrific Mai Tai.This is NOT a romantic date kind of place. It's loud. But if you're into sports  it's a great place to watch a game as long as you can find a table. Parking can be a drag--you either valet park (grr)  or brave a hideously-designed ramp up to the top level of the tiny parking garage. Don't even THINK of trying that if your car is lower than your average sedan... either park across the street or use the valet. Overall  a good place for a relaxed meal  or for drinks with friends.
Myro B.,Burbank  CA,163,17,,12/21/2012,3.0,Love their spinach artichoke deep
Manoj N.,Stevenson Ranch  CA,144,816,100,2/23/2013,3.0,Even though I lived and work in the neighborhood  I went to their happy hour for the first time yesterday with colleagues from work. First off the happy hours prices are not happy. Its only about a $1 less than regular prices. The food portions are very small so I ended up ordering the regular dinner sandwich. Food is just okay and tending towards terrible. The fries I got seemed cold and looking back I should have sent it back to the kitchen. I got the wildberry mojito ( 2 rounds) and they were pretty good. Strong in alcohol and flavor. Beware of the valet parking trick. The valet goons will stand along the parking driveway as if there is only valet parking. But thats not true  just drive past them and into the parking structure on the right side. Its free there after 3 pm.
Stephanie S.,San Fernando  CA,17,37,,8/14/2010,5.0,I've been to this location and to Glendale countless times. During my most recent visit  I experienced the best service I've ever received -- anywhere.It was a bustling Thursday night and the place was crowded with high school students and birthday parties. The wait staff was clearly busy  so I did not get my side salad until the entree arrived  and they forgot to include pineapple salsa with my salmon.It wasn't a big deal -- I'm not one to be fussy  especially with my favorite restaurant. However  they more than made up for their mistakes without me even having to ask! I received many apologies from both our waiter and the manager... then they completely took my entree off the bill (it's a $15 dish) and gave us a free pizooki!This is why I come back again & again. Not only is the food hot  fresh & delicious each time  but the staff is friendly  considerate  and more than happy to make your experience enjoyable. I moved here from the Midwest last year  and it's appalling how horrible the customer service is! This is one chain that I can count on. I don't understand why it only averages 3.5 stars and I'm shocked that reviewers are complaining about the prices. It's about the same as The Cheesecake Factory  El Torito  or pretty much anywhere else in Los Angeles.If the beer prices are a little more than what you're used to  it's because BJ's brews their own beer -- and it's totally worth it. Ask for a half-and-half pitcher of Hefeweizen & Berry Cider!
Gabriel A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,12/22/2013,1.0,So I haven't been to bj for a while and after this experience I don't think I'll be back first they took almost 40 minutes to bring us our food and then the salmon we ordered was raw so they took it back and they finally brought us the salmon to find out there was a hair in the broccoli! Not a good experience I was very disappointed with the service and I questioned the cleanliness of the kitchen.
Clayton W.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,15,144,,6/11/2010,4.0,Is BJ's fine dining?God  no.But the beer is great and all of the food is very workmanlike and tasty for a brewery. Go with a friend and get a pitcher of the Jeremiah Red or PM Porter  or if you feel like walking around Burbank in the zone between buzzed and drunk for about an hour  go with the extremely flavorful Tatonka Stout.Food I get often includes the Meatloaf  Buffalo Chicken Pizza  and the Beef Dip. These aren't trendsetting or amazingly innovative meals  but they're always flavorful and done consistently right. As a result  BJ's is always an extremely agreeable choice for the neighborhood  franchise or no franchise.
Marlaina R.,GRANADA HILLS  CA,128,141,56,6/2/2012,4.0,You can't go wrong with this place  really. The menu is extensive and the lunch specials are an insane value. Most importantly  PIZZOOKIE. That is all.
Anasheh H.,Glendale  CA,28,12,8,12/12/2013,1.0,"First of all- I don\'t usually write reviews but when I do it\'s either the place deserves business or doesn\'t deserve business. I don\'t even know where to start. To start off  they were out of Pepsi  and almost every appetizer I wanted. That wasn\'t so bad. Then my food came out and I asked for ranch because the container that should\'ve had ranch was missing the ranch. That was ok too. So I asked for plates. That took 25 minutes to come out. So by the time the plates were out I told my waiter that my food was cold and he said well ""these don\'t usually come out with plates"" this guy loved to talk back. On top of that he pointed out that he spilled the ranch on him and that\'s why he didn\'t bring that out. So I asked for the manager.. The waiter comes back and says ""the manager told me you can have a pazookie"" ummmmm I never asked for a pazookie actually I asked for a manager and he never showed up!!!!!! Terrible service and I can guarantee you I will go back to find out this waiters name to add it to this review. If I could give this this place no stars I would. This was Unbelievable."
Roberto S.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,11/3/2013,1.0,"If I could give a no star  I would. Bad  bad  horrible service. We arrived and even though there were tables  we had to wait over 1/2 hour. When we finally were seated  even after ordering our drinks  they took forever to bring them. When the food finally arrived  mostly it was cold. All the plates came in at different times. Their motto was ""the other ones are coming after."" Some of us started eating 1.5 hours after we arrived. We decided that we would give them a chance due that it was my moms birthday. So we order their bazookie or whatever their dessert was. It took over 1/2 hour. The whole ordeal took over 3 1/2 hours. We were very dissatisfied. Don\'t come here!!!!"
Chris D.,Irvine  CA,2082,312,51,8/27/2009,2.0,Now if i gave the newer and better Glendale Bj's a 3 star then for sure I have to give this a 2.5. Simple. PARKING! that damn one floor of parking isn't enough for my family(no were not Mexican and don't all squish in one car) [ that was all in good humor nothing racist]. But seriously  the only plus this one has over the Glendale one is the wait time  definitely less  I feel it is bigger then the Glendale one and busier since the AMC is right around the corner  Oh well you get my drift!TFR
Paul D.,Los Angeles  CA,11,38,11,3/27/2010,4.0,It's my fourth time eating at this BJs so here goes. First  they make you wait in their waiting area for 10-15 minutes  so that once they sit you down  you wait another 10-15 minutes for mediocre service and your food... So once they finally get to you  they start you off with drinks and appetizers. I've never had their beer but I have heard that it is good... I'll have to try it for myself some day... Anyway  their soft drinks are $2.95... I always get the Strawberry Lemonade which is pretty darn good.For appetizers  if calamari is available I always order it and wudduya know? They have it for $8.95 and it is pretty awesome. It has the right amount of crispiness so that you can enjoy the taste  not like other places where it's not crispy enough or just too crispy. It comes with two lemons  marinara dip  and ranch dip. For the main course I get the Scampi Pasta  because I love shrimp  but here's the kicker  instead of the Angel Hair and Roma tomatoes that it originally comes with  I ask for Fettuccine and Sun Dried Tomatoes!!! This costs $14.95. You seriously gotta try it!!! You most definitely won't regret it!!! : )Finally for dessert  their signature Pizookie for $5... something... sorry I can't remember off the top of my head but it's usually just under $6. Anyway  I always get the White Chocolate Macadamia with Vanilla Ice-Cream. Haven't had any other one but this one has never let me down. If you do end up eating at BJs  don't leave without having a Pizookie!!! So aside from the wait and mediocre service  the food is what gave them a four. The fact that they actually do the changes I request and the quality of the taste is good. It's not great  but I do need a BJs pasta n Pizookie fix here and there...
Denise A.,San Fernando  CA,0,34,7,3/18/2011,1.0,"I\'ve been here plenty of times  but this last time I went will def. be the last time. We barely had recieved our appetizer  and there on our booth  was a ROACH!!!! a ROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The waitress and manager  kindly asked us not to make a big scene  and told us that they get inspected like every week for this. Very convincing.. NOT! seems to me this happens often  seeing as the manager was very ""cool"" about it. I really don\'t have anything else to say.."
Miguel O.,El Monte  CA,2,117,,3/9/2010,3.0,"The name is what gets people to come inside this place. What were you expecting? A whorehouse? It sez  ""Restaurant and Brewery"" on the sign.Their happy hour is pretty good  not great  but good. The appetizers during this period are a really good deal. The mini pizzas are all pretty good  share 3 of \'em with friends. The drink menu is interesting. BJs makes their own beer  but not on the premises of course. That operation is done elsewhere. The beer vats are just for show apparently. I like the seasonal trappist style ale they make (winter time I guess). The porter is okay and the rest of their beers are average. During happy hour the beer prices are good. Even better is getting a drink though that would cost you $9 or $10 normally and paying like $4 or $5 for it. They make a good Long Island Ice Tea here too  in other words  they don\'t leave out the tequila like most people do.Can\'t see myself coming to a BJs a lot  and parking sucks at this place during the day  the staff is alright but not great. If you don\'t know where to go for happy hour and need some breathing room this place might be alright for you."
Gary E.,Los Angeles  CA,0,22,,6/29/2012,4.0,The Burbank location is way better then the one at Glendale  I think it's bigger too  classic place good food huge plasma T.V's and we always find parking
Leens B.,Los Angeles  CA,6,23,4,3/25/2010,3.0,BJ's is the type of place that it makes sense to order dinner from on a late working night--there's something for everyone on the menu (same with Granville Cafe  CPK  Cheesecake Factory and every other slightly too pricey  generic chain restaurant). I guess that explains how I feel about all those restaurants...The avocado egg rolls with the accompanying sauce are super yummy! The portions are gigantic and you'll have leftovers unless it's a salad and there's no point in keeping lettuce to go wilty. I had the bbq chicken pizza  which was tasty but it's certainly no chicago deep dish.
Brenda F.,Los Angeles  CA,56,3,,5/20/2014,1.0,My friends and I ordered a table for 20 people at first the service was going okay  but once we sat down. My friends and I didnt get a waiter to take are order until  I had to go to the counter and ask the host if he could take are order since we had been waiting for 30 minutes already. The manger came got are order at 11:30p.m & are food was not delivered until 12:45p.m. We waited so much just for are food and to top it off are food was cold . We complain twice so they could warm are food. I honestly didnt want to stay any longer & left . This place was so horrible . Dont go here specially with a large group. I would like to be contacted because I love bJ but the customer serivce their is horrible.
Gene S.,Burbank  CA,0,11,3,10/9/2012,4.0,Nice selection of beers  including the guest ones! Appetizers are so far all very good with the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps in first place  and fantastic pizza!
Martha L.,Los Angeles  CA,4,58,425,12/5/2011,5.0,"My boyfriend and i decided to go to bj\'s and have some pizza and beer.It was saturday night and the wait was 30-45 min for 2 people  we do not have thaTmuch time because i have a 5 month old baby to get back to asap so we took a pager and started looking for seats at the bar. My bf sees 2 people leaving and we scored 2 seats in the bar area which were perfect  high table for 2 directly in front of the televisions. We were approached immediately and had our table wiped down.we started off with 2 jeremiah reds my favorite beer there  i noticed they changed their uniforms because i used to work in the bj\'s at glendale. the girl was very happy to tell us why and when they made this change. She was very friendly and understanding to all of our needs. We ordered the best beginnings as our appetizer and doubled the spinach dip. The only annoying part was that there was a couple sitting next ot us on a date and the girl just kept talking louder and louder  I think she was obviously getting sloppy drunk and the guy was so nervous he kept shaking his foot and that drives me crazy. i turned side ways to face my boyfriend and enjoy his company instead of getting mad. He ordered a clam chowder which was super good  and the food runner brought a second one  i told him we already had one and he said ""now you have another"" woo hoo! Finally we ended with a bbq chicken pizza (sooo good). Nothing could have made our night better. Until i decided that i just had to take a couple of glasses home to drink beer later. I asked the girl instead of just stealing them if she could charge me for 2 glasses or if i could have them. I was shocked when she said i could take them and even brought me 2 fresh clean glasses from the back. WOW!!We really had a great fun time  and really enjoyed the service  we never had to look for our server to get anything  she was always there. Eventually she had to go home and introduced the next cocktail girl to us and we decided to close the tab out with her so that we could show her our appreciation with a nice tip.For this pleasant evening i give them FIVE STARS!!"
Chelsea D.,La Canada Flintridge  CA,92,23,,2/22/2014,1.0,Came in for lunch  my burger was pretty bad and made me feel sick afterwards. The service was lacking. Over all it's such a mediocre restaurant- the prices they charge are almost criminal.
Gerard I.,Pasadena  CA,500,806,351,11/17/2008,5.0,Das Bier. I love premium beer. I forgot what we ordered. I think I had the blackened chicken potato  you can never go wrong with that gigantic 'tater. We split a pitcher of Tatanka  and a beer sampler. I think we were pretty buzzed off of the sampler even before we got to the pitcher of Tatanka. I think we also ordered a Pizookie towards the end. Pizookie washed down by some premium beer is good eatin'!
Leah A.,Burbank  CA,10,62,20,9/4/2011,2.0,I understand large groups can be a challenge  but come on! This many screw ups  so not acceptable! We've had delayed orders  wrong checks and orders  and terribly cooked dishes. Our last visit was especially awful. Two of our friends had to send back orders of the ahi poke because they weren't fresh and they royally messed up on our check. Not to mention we kept getting mystery dishes sent to our table not belonging to anyone. By the end of the night i felt like i was being punked and we were going to see cameras pop up from under the table.We ended up staying there waaay longer then we wanted to get the mess all cleared up. What a bummer  cuz BJs used to be a great hang out place : (
Mari D.,North Hollywood  CA,19,69,,6/20/2012,4.0,I recently came here and got the BBQ pulled sandwich with wedge cut fries that was amazingly delicious. Our waiter for that evening was very helpful. You can't leave this place until you try a pazookie!!! The pazookie's are so freaking delicious!!!
Kat B.,Glendale  CA,0,1,1,6/29/2013,2.0,i usually like coming here but we got our meal to go this time and first of all theres no sweet potato fries. ok fine just do regular fries but when i come home i dont want to see mashed potatoes. my plate portion was a sad looking cold piece of chicken with a sad side of no dressing salad and 3 pieces of grilled onion. no way !! that is not the amount or what you get when u sit down! and it happened before. im bummed out! attached my picture. i mean i paid a fair amount of $
Frances L.,Los Angeles  CA,1425,1184,462,11/5/2010,3.0,I am by no means a fan of their beer here. Sorry  folks  but if you're going to go the microbrew way  then California's got tons of better places for that sort of thing so the huge BJ's chain just doesn't make the cut. HOWEVER  BJ's does have pretty good food  so not all hope is lost! Their rendition of pub classics and hearty American comfort food is pretty good and at a decent price too. The service varies with each location  but I tend to drop by this Burbank location over the one in Westwood because it seems less crowded. They make a pretty good draught root beer for you non-alcoholics  but be warned: it's suuuuper sweet. AND  you can't leave without having a pizookie. It's a MUST.
Marion S.,North Hollywood  CA,180,102,39,1/4/2009,3.0,"""It\'s not a bad place to go but there are just better out there. I know I say that in most of my reviews but it holds true at BJs.It\'s a cool place to go with some friends and have a few drinks. That\'s the one great thing about this place  you get some friends and a few drinks and you can never have a bad time.Let\'s start with the food shall we. I can\'t speak poorly of the food nor can I speak highly of it either. Certain things are better than others however. I\'d stay away from their burgers  I\'ve never been a fan of it. Their sandwiches though  depending on what you get can be good. I remember getting the Turkey California Club once and it left me full and satisfied. The Jambalaya is good and really spicy. I once had the pasta and it was just meh. The meatloaf is worth getting if you\'re hungry and don\'t want to chew.However the two best things to get here are their HUGE baked potatoes or their pizza. The potato can be kind of a crap shoot. Sometimes it\'s cooked perfectly and other times not so much. If you\'re hungry and are on a high carb diet or just want to die of gluttony  I say get the baked potato. It\'s prepared a few different ways. I\'m a fan of the Broccoli and Cheese with Alfredo sauce. So many calories yet so much goodness.Their pizzas are some of the best I\'ve had. I\'m not a fan of deep dish pizzas but I am when I\'m here. Usually deep dish pizzas can be chewy but that isn\'t the case here. Sure you may need to eat your pizza with a knife and fork  which I\'ve been informed makes you less of a man. (Sidebar: Thin crust pizza FTW!)Best way to have a meal here is to wash it down with something alcoholic. As it says in it\'s name  BJ\'s is a brewery so they make their own beers here and only serve their own beers (with the exception of a Chimay I believe). Their beers are OK  but I\'m only a fan of their lighter beers. The blond and hef are probably the best.Once you\'re piss drunk and full  you\'re gonna wanna get the pizookie or the brownie. Both are just cookies (or a brownie) warm from the oven and they pile on a few scoops of ice cream. There\'s nothing really special about it but it\'s just so good.All in all  it\'s a great place to go but it\'s just average."""
Kelly S.,Minneapolis  MN,111,250,12,2/28/2011,1.0,do you enjoy standing at the host stand being ignored by a hostess while she has a long conversation with her friend? this is just the place for you!
Jake C.,Garden City  MI,27,46,,1/24/2011,1.0,the service most always sucks at this BJs tried it again and yea still sucks try glendale BJs it not to far from here don't go here unless you want a stressful frustrating experience
Terra O.,Los Angeles  CA,658,118,332,7/15/2011,5.0,5 stars for having one of the best deserts I've ever had! You must try the bazookie when you visit! Even if you're stuffed  do it! Their sample beer platter is also great!
Ryan C.,Los Angeles  CA,96,161,1198,2/11/2009,5.0,Whenever my friends and I are in the mood for deep dish style pizza and a cold pitcher of beer.... this is the spot!You can't go wrong with a large BBQ chicken pizza and 2-3 pitchers of the Piranha pale ale while catching the game on the flat screens or just enjoying great conversations amongst one another.Everything I've tried on their menu is pretty good and never disappoints. I highly recommend you try their Famous Pizookie which is probably one of my favorite desserts of all time. Damn!.. I can definitely go for one right about now!
Sal D.,Haddonfield  NJ,1214,542,362,9/28/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,came here for the 2 for 20  food was great service was horrible.
Joey H.,Los Angeles  CA,62,320,3,9/24/2013,5.0,me and my friend come here as a reward after our hikes in the hills nearby. we talk about coming here before  during and after the hike so we really enjoy this place. its a nice place and its always clean when we come. we always share a large veggie. its so good! i dont think we ever took home any leftovers. the last time we went we also had the avocado egg rolls. thats good too  i can eat a couple of orders if i let myself. but its all about the pizza when you come here! btw  she always gets the pizookie  lol.
Soo C.,Alhambra  CA,81,192,26,3/15/2011,2.0,This was my second time here. Food was good nothing spectacular. Service was pleasant. The prices were standard. Just a Ho-Hum place. I grew up in Chicago so I'm not a fan of their pizza.
Brian R.,Burbank  CA,203,110,46,11/9/2008,3.0,"Got a mystery coupon in the mail to try out their fall food specials so we took a trip to BJ\'s on a Sunday. It was game day so people were cheering and screaming at their teams on one of the many tv\'s around the restaurant. The Bar was packed  and it defiantly was a noisy experience. We started out with a garden salad  which was nothing special  the tomatoes were a little mushy  but not too bad.I got the parmesan crusted chicken which was delicious  its drizzled with a cream sauce that I had to request for more of (because without it  the chicken was dry). The broccoli and mash potatoes were average.The lady got the jambalaya  which was filled with shrimp and chicken sausage. It had a nice taste and spice to it. We didnt try the beer  but it looked like a good selection. The prices seemed right  and my only complaint was the service didnt seem very friendly  and it was loud. Being a ""brewery"" I guess this isnt the best place for a quiet romantic dinner.I liked BJ\'s  i\'m sure it would be a great place to watch a game and drink some beers  but I also dont think I would ever crave BJ\'s. It is what it is."
Xochilt P.,PACOIMA  CA,0,3,,1/22/2013,1.0,This is been the worst service ever  specially the server name: Dustin  he is the bad waiter  no skills at all  really unprofessional. he is racist and has an anger Management problems. He got bother because he didn't like the tip we left him  he started yelling all over the restaurant assaulting us with really bad words. and he left slamming the back kitchen door  really what service is this.. i right away reported to BBB  still waiting for call to further discuss this with my attorney. never ever experience such bad service with BJ's  The manager Nick Momayez was no help at all  he did not even express the sorry he had when he told us  he will take care of it. really bad service by this server Dustin.... trust me this is not going to stay like this...
Elizabeth B.,Baltimore  MD,9,20,,9/29/2009,4.0,So... yeah. I met up with some friends down in Burbank last Friday. Being totally unfamiliar with the area (I live on the East Coast  my fam is in Ventura)  I let them do the choosing of the place to eat  and BJs was chosen. Why? Well  mostly because we're all a bunch of lushes and they do their own beer.I did not mention that I'd eaten at the BJs in Oxnard the night before. That'll be our wee secret  okie doke?I ordered hefeweizen tonight. Yum. A vast improvement over the way-too-weirdly-tart-but-sweet cider of the night before. Really  any place that does their own beer is going to get three stars to start from me. As long as they're  yanno  good at it.I ordered a salad (a damn good salad smothered but not drowned in awesome honey mustard--there's another half star)  my compatriots ordered the BBQ burger pizza sans cheese and the sauce. Our waitress was tits  y'all. She dealt with some odd requests and other eccentricities with aplomb and good grace. Not to say we were dickish about said requests  just that she didn't get pissy about them--very helpful and well-trained. I wish I could remember her name.Oh well. What you really want to hear about is those cookies  right? God*damn*  they're good. Pizookies  they call them? Yeah  I don't get why  but who really cares? they're humongous and warm and gooey and come with ice cream. I attempted one all by my lonesome on this trip and failed utterly. I only got halfway through. I was sad to have to abandon the other half.here's a tip for you regarding the parking: if you know your way around  park at the mall and walk. just don't lose your spot or forget which garage is the east one  like we did.
Natalie A.,Porter Ranch  Los Angeles  CA,33,66,31,9/21/2009,4.0,I hate that I love EVERYTHING on the menu.pizza's are bomb  appetizers are awesome  love the nachos! should I have a sandwich? Maybe a stuffed baked potato? a pitcher of beer (or berry burst cider) and i'm in heaven!yeah  this is life. I'm pretty easy to please =)
Jessica K.,Los Angeles  CA,166,253,111,11/11/2008,3.0,I magically got a coupon in the mail and we figured what the heck  lets check it out..They have BJ's in TX but i kept forgetting* that there was one so close to us out here in Burbank. We had to park on the second level garage  BUT be careful driving up the steep ramp to park - dont get hit by a car and dont hit another car  it was a little tight. The place was packed for Football Sunday-we had to wait about 20 mins before getting seated at this god awful table that was basically in a walkway  im a booth kinda girl..**Heads up  you can call ahead for a table and if we come here again I will definitely call ahead** I got the Jambalaya with shrimp  blackened chicken and chicken-andouille sausage on top of a bed of dirty rice..Whewee! it was spicy  and trust me I LOVE SPICY  BUT not this spicy and salty Bleh. The service was decent but the food was mediocre  nothing too great. I do like that they have a large alcohol selection though. So  I think next time we will come here for beers and apps  not dinner..
Sean W.,Burbank  Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,4/3/2013,1.0,On a Saturday night at 5:00pm this BJ'S was seriously understaffed. The wait took 45 min when half the restaurant was empty. A large party behind us was seated first and got their food first 30 min before us. We were at this BJ'S for an hour and a half before we got our food. And that's after talking to the manager twice. I will not  be coming back.
Gina G.,Cleveland  OH,562,465,232,9/15/2008,4.0,I am a self-admitted BJ's junkie. I have a pretty set menu of items I order when I come here. The Field of Greens Salad. I order it with blackened chicken. The mix of the baby greens  chicken  candied pecans  red onions  mandarin oranges  feta cheese  roasted red bell peppers and yummy raspberry vinegarette is out of this world! I also love the crispy appetizer pizzas and the chicken pot stickers! Yum! I almost always try to save room for a chocolate chip Pizooki. Best shit ever!
Tommy c.,Los Angeles  CA,207,16,16,11/29/2008,3.0,ahhhh another wonderful night of eatery with the friends. This trip though  i actually tried the beers.. not a beer person here. The taste of it wasnt for me i guess. I shall stick to my mixed drinks and shots. hahah.On this trip  i decided to get the same thing as my last  a nice two topping mini pizza which was half off because of happy hour  and a plate of wings. The pizza was soooo good. i tried some of walters Cheeseburger pizza  damn! that was a pretty good pizza. My stomach was starting to hurt a little because of the beers but i was fine after a few burps. ahahThis place overall is pretty chill. a cool place to grab a bite and watch a few games. The waiter was ok  took a few for refills and such but they were pretty chill about having 5 of us at the bar area. i personally like the glendale one. if you like beer  this is your spot.Later days.
Siddeeqah B.,Sherman Oaks  CA,13,16,,9/3/2010,4.0,I like BJs. It's got ok food something you can bare to eat. I'ts a great place to have a beer and watch the game.
Cat A.,Plano  TX,10,118,19,7/31/2009,5.0,OMG the pizookie is SO GOOD. For anyone who is a fan of chocolate & warm soft desserts  you cannot go wrong with the Cookies and Cream pizookie. It is soo good mmm my mouth is watering right now...It's $6  but well worth it! Their pizza is good too...but I don't come here for that. It's all about the pizookie.
Erin H.,Santa Monica  CA,238,171,17,7/5/2008\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Yep  still sucks. I mean  as long as you don't eat food here you'll be OK. But if you're one of those people who goes to restaurants to eat you might be a little upset. Even the famed Pizookie doesn't do it for me. It's just abig grocery store bakery cookie with a scoop of ice cream. Don't try to tell me you just baked that thing and that's why it's warm. I know what a microwave is.
Ella B.,Los Olivos  CA,26,628,12,7/20/2008,1.0,"We met up with my friend after going through the IKEA maze. We were starving and pizza seemed like a good idea. We were seated quickly and that was about all the quickness for the night. Elizabeth A. was our server. We were a group of 3 seated next to a group of 33! ok  maybe not 33  but something to the tune of 10 adults and 5 kids. maybe our server was a little overwhelmed and maybe she was new  but really  that\'s irrelevant b/c that\'s not my problem  it\'s hers. just like when i am having a crappy day  it\'s my problem  not my clients. see  i\'m fair!anyway  so *finally* our waters were brought out... by another server mind you. *finally* Elizabeth A. decides to take our order. We ordered beers first.  i was nearly done with my beer when Elizabeth A. *finally* decides that she\'s at work after all and takes our food orders. We ordered  one spinach artichoke pizza  one chicken dish and shrimp tacos. the food came out promptly and each of them were decent. the pizza wasn\'t half bad  and if I were judging them solely on food  i would go 4 stars. The beers were pretty decent too. 4 stars for beer. We also order the apple cobbler thingy for dessert and it was ok. not bad  but not as fantastic as the description in the menu would have you believe. the service was spotty throughout the whole night and at one point it was like Lizzie realised that she was sucking ass so she was trying to be our friend. yeah  thanks but no thanks  you\'re my server and all i really expect you to do is bring my food and bring it with manners  not this ""yah"" ""what\'s up?"" bullsh*t. m\'kay? you don\'t say ""what\'s up?"" to a female customer that already doesn\'t like you  it doesn\'t work that i may find you cute. try it with the guys  it may work better  in fact i\'m sure it will work better. I realise that i must be sounding like a stuck up little skank and I very well may be  but this is so cal  i\'m far from being mean  yet. anyway  the FINAL straw were two things (yeah  really the final two  b/c up till this point i was going to tip her). 1) she brought the bill and just dropped it off  no words  like ""whenever you\'re ready""  ""take your time"" or even: ""can i get you anything else?"" NO  NONE  ZIPPO  NADA. really. 2) we wanted to split the cards and she grabbed the check and didn\'t ask us how we wanted to split it. She grabbed it so fast WHILE I was still having dessert so i didn\'t have a chance to stop her. and it may just be me  but i generally don\'t find it necessary nor desirable to chase down my server in order to pay my bill!so  she split it in 1/2 which was NOT THE WAY I WANTED IT DONE ELIZABETH A. I wanted $20 on one and the rest on the other  capiche? next time  ASK when you SEE two ccards in the holder. it won\'t hurt to ask  really it\'s better to ask than to assume things.anyway  so when the bill came  i DIDN\'T tip her b/c most of the night she didn\'t serve us. yea  and i\'m the customer that wrote you a nice little note so if you don\'t like it  try harder next time. Bottom line:4 stars for the beer & food.3 stars for ambiance.0 stars for servicethis review is based on service - if ya couldn\'t tell....if you want deep dish pizza  i suggest take out...."
Karen O.,Canyon Country  CA,0,13,,2/17/2014,2.0,"We had family coming from several different areas (Long Beach  Santa Clarita  and Northridge) so this seemed like the perfect  convenient  something-for-everyone place to meet. One person in our group said they hated BJ\'s  but we talked them into going there anyways. After all  it\'s BJ\'s....they have TONS of stuff on their menu  there has to be something you want! We talked him into coming there by promising a pizookie!The hostesses were great. Friendly and helpful in picking a table with easy access for one person in our party who has some difficulty getting around. Waiter came to our table immediately  and although he talked a mile a minute and mumbled which made him hard to understand  he was very friendly. Drinks were fine. Appetizer (Chicken Lettuce Wraps) was just okay.Waiter changed as our original waiter went home...but the new waiter was very nice and very personable. He answered tons of questions.We ordered our food for the five of us.....and then we waited....and waited....and waited.We finally asked about our soup and salads that came with our order after about 25 minutes. The waiter made an excuse about waiting for the soup  and then showed up about 5 minutes later with our soup/salad. Cesar salad was blah. Not much flavor in the dressing. Our food came about 20 minutes after that. Yes  we waited over 45 minutes for our food.Buffalo burger was cold. Moroccan Salmon was cold. Santa Fe Rolls were cold. Pizza was cold. Quesadilla was cold. The only thing served to us that was hot were the beans that came with the quesadilla!One item was ordered with no avocado  but came with avocado. The pizza which was supposed to have mushrooms  didn\'t even have the mushrooms. Our meal was pathetic. We started to send the food back  but the waiter didn\'t seem confident that we would get it back any time soon. So  most of us ate the cold food. Except for the one in our group who hadn\'t wanted to go there at all....he just sat and shook his head saying ""Told you so!"" and wouldn\'t even touch his pizza.  He couldn\'t get out of that place fast enough. Skip the pazookie! Not worth it!The waiter did send the manager to our table and after expressing our disappointment  she did comp the entire meal. The ENTIRE meal. We certainly didn\'t expect that!I do give her credit for accepting responsibility for the lousy meal  and that\'s why I gave two stars instead of one. But we won\'t be going back. Next time  we listen to the kid who likes everything  but hates BJ\'s!"
Adam G.,Long Beach  CA,0,20,,2/7/2014,5.0,I love the food at BJs  plenty of choices for varying diets (meat  vegetarian  etc) and everything I've had there has been delicious. They have a good selection of drinks as well  I enjoyed seeing items from many local/SoCal breweries on the list. The restaurant was a little loud due to a large  teenage birthday party nearby but even still it wasn't a bad experience by any means. Service was great  we'll definitely be back
Artin F.,Encino  CA,65,120,3,9/18/2011,4.0,Even thou i don't live in Burbank anymore  the Burbank BJ's is still the best one. It's cozy  always pretty load and happening. Love sitting at the bar and watch a game.
Jenna W.,TARZANA  CA,158,50,1,9/17/2013,4.0,Went last weekend and had a great time. The atmosphere is open and there is lots of energy and fun all around. Will return with friends again!
Alya G.,Woodland Hills  CA,41,31,53,4/28/2009,4.0,"I have been to nearly all BJS breweries around LA and Ventura county so you may say I am a fan.I actually think that those places have no competition or anything alike which would also be a chain...Gordon Birch maybe but those are so rare.Their menu is huge and offers anything form wraps to steaks to soups to pastas name it they have it. Anyone in your group will probably be able to find something to the taste on the menu. Needless to mention they are famous for their pizzas and beers. They brew their own beers which are pretty good and have Belgian beer menu where you can find some pretty weird beers form all over the place ( please try the lambics yum!). As for pizza  it is supposed to be ""Chicago style"" and is pretty damn good   although as I have heard from people who actually lived in Chicago is nothing like pizzas over there.The only downfall I can mention about the place is the fact that their dessert menu is non existent. Sorry  Pizzuky just doesn\'t cut it for me.BJS is great for groups  casual parties  or just drop in for dinner  although you might have to wait a while to be seated. So call and try to reserve!"
Jessie S.,Burbank  CA,10,206,24,5/17/2010,4.0,I know I've mentioned in previous reviews that I usually only go for pizza with medium  chewy crust and lots of drippy cheese that you can fold in half and stuff in you face. This is the very clear exception to that rule. I cannot vouch for the other food on BJ's menu - though my tablemate and fellow yelper Kim H. got a roast chicken meal which apparently was horrible - but I can say this: their deep dish Mediterranean pizza makes me happy. Very  very happy. A 'mini' pizza is the perfect size to fill me up  I got a 'small' last night and am having the leftovers for lunch today. Don't trust your server to give you an accurate size estimate  three others at my table got 'medium' sizes and will be eating pizza for the rest of eternity. Not that that's a bad thing  I assure you.So by merit of their pizza  four stars. Everything else...couldn't tell ya. I almost ordered a sandwich until I realized it was the same price as the pizza for something I could probably assemble at home.
Cindy R.,Granada Hills  CA,15,85,1,6/24/2011,4.0,Love BJ's!!! They have a good deal with samples of beers!!!
Marci P.,Chatsworth  CA,8,57,13,7/4/2010,2.0,I went to BJ's a few nights ago on a week night. We got there about 7:30 pm and it was really noisy. We chose to eat outside- very pleasant with a great view of the freshly mowed grass and the parking lot. We had a nice server and split a mini pizza and turkey club sandwich. It took a while but both were good  not great  and reasonably priced. I then went into the women's bathroom and  to my disgust  saw a fairly large roach. I thought I better step on it to preserve the evidence cuz I was blown away that a major chain restaurant would have bugs crawling around in plain site. (sorry animal lovers!) I then went to tell the manager of my find. He told me he was sorry but since roaches only go where there is food it must have been a 'water bug'. I mean really- who the fuck cares?-it was a big bug strolling around in your restaurant! He then proceeded to tell me he would take care of it and thanked me for telling him about it. That's it. WTF? Why not offer me 10% off or a free pizookie for the trauma I went thru? I thought that was crummy customer service and I couldn't believe he didn't offer me anything for my bad experience. I liked the food and I liked the service but don't tell me it's ok to have a bug in your restaurant just cuz it's a water bug!?! As we were leaving we saw the manager and he thanked me again for telling him about the bug. I told him 'You're welcome and make sure you read the review I'm going to write on Yelp'.....
Damir T.,Burbank  CA,14,10,,6/11/2012,1.0,Bad service bad food bad beer bartender was short uninterested and didnt know whats on the specials menu had beer it was bad stale and old i got sick from it after first sip  so sad they have not closed this place by now and opened Something fun.
Billy J.,Chicago  IL,0,11,,8/6/2012,1.0,I was just there 5 minutes ago. I brought my family. We sat down and we sat there for exactly 15 min and watched everyone get served. We didn't even get a drink order nor did any server introduce themselves. We got up to leave and the greeter who sat us and who I had a 3 min convo with earlier about a high chair  smiled and said have a nice day  lol. She just saw us sit down. Our table was right next to the front. She kept passing us and she noticed us the entire time. I thought for sure  she would ask if everything was okay. Maybe she knew their service sucked and was embarrassed. Lol what a joke of a place. I will never go there again.
Carl F.,Glendale  CA,25,60,,7/9/2011,3.0,i love drinking beer here but the service stinks a lot of the time. Went with my 30 yr old pal from Germany. He had a passport. The manager told us no way. And he didnt care where he was from. Very rude things to say. So we left. Theres on in Glendale now with different managers that i will go to if im in the mood for one of their beers.
Adam C.,Burbank  CA,13,68,,10/12/2010,4.0,Place has great food  but the evening bartender has no idea how to make drinks. I was with a group of three and he had to remake our drinks several times before getting it right. Otherwise its a pretty good place to hang out.
Jessica P.,Sunland  CA,1,17,,10/21/2011,4.0,Great food  polite staff... wonderful lunch specials! Their hot wings are to die for and the spinach artichoke pizza will blow your mind.
Bridgyn O.,Sherman Oaks  CA,179,121,10,6/27/2008,4.0,Solid 4 stars  if you love you some deep dish pizza go here. I usually don;t stray far from the pizza and avocado egg rolls which are super good too! They brew there own beers and I love the Jeremiah red mm mm super tasty red beer. I have not had much else beside the pizza here because i mean why fix something if it's not broke. If you are a cookie lover the pizookie is gonna blow your mind. A giant hot right out of the oven cookie with vanilla ice cream on top MMMMMMMMMMMMM. Gets real crowded on weekends so be prepared to wait a little  and it does get a little loud if you sit near the bar  well actually the whole restaurant is pretty loud but great food!
Griz M.,Culver - West  CA,17,27,,6/14/2011,4.0,Love the variety on the menu and the pizzas are just so delicious!. What's best is that I can order for delivery too! at labite.com for any of those who dont know. Yummy!
Ellie L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,35,14,12/26/2012,2.0,"BJ\'s is a great restaurant and honestly  who can resist those pazookies?! However  after my experience there last week  I won\'t be going to this BJ\'s again. BJ\'s is always ridiculously busy  and this one charges for valet parking. Limited self-parking  but the whole parking lot is always full.I went here and ordered the California burger medium well (which is a little pink in the center) - avocado  chipotle mayo  creamy ranch - sounds great! I added bacon However  I made it clear to my server that I wanted ONLY BACON  NO CHEESE. So you can imagine my disappointment when out comes my burger and I\'m staring straight at a cheeseburger. It took extremely long to get our server to come over  and I told him  ""I don\'t think this is my burger."" he stares at it and goes  ""no it\'s not"" and took it back with the promise to get me the right burger. A couple minutes later  the manager heard what happened and came over to apologize. As the manager is apologizing  our server came out with my (correct) burger. however  now my steak fries had changed to the string fries. I politely noted this and the server reached to take my burger back again. The manager stopped him and told him to leave my burger and just bring me a side of the correct fries.  I was unimpressed with the service or how long it took to get my order delivered correctly. It was hard to get a hold of our server the rest of the night and it took about 10 minutes for him to come pick up our check."
James S.,Los Angeles  CA,561,1194,627,1/6/2009,5.0,This is our regular haunt me and my lovely movie buddyWe usually catch a coupe drinks before we head out to the Burbank AMC16 just up the blockLately  we have gone every single week either on a friday or saturday to drink up a storm before heading into the theaters. I know why even watch a movie  when you being entertained at the bar? Well we are movie buffs and have a long list of movies to see plus we are tanks! We can handle our own or we like to think we can. Our favorite and regular bartender is Matt he is tall and caucasian if you were wondering when you stroll in and head over to the bar. That man right there can make a killer Bloody Mary  actually he mixes his own ingredients and not what BJ standards prefer which is bogus because his are awesome. Go check it out and you might see me and my movie buddy one of these days drinking it up  we arent hard to spot. Loud and Sexy
Michael A.,Glendale  CA,4,11,19,5/6/2013,3.0,one of you typical rest. chain. service was good. beer sampler was pretty decent. overall all the food was good nothing too great. the best part as usual was the poozokie (oreo). just make sure to get one if you go.
kimberly a.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,,11/22/2010,4.0,The food is great especially the spinach dip  parmesan crusted chicken and pizookies. Don't expect the best service  but that's to be expected at a chain restaurant. One problem: Do not get take out at this location!They completely rip you off when you get take out here. Sometimes when we get home and finally see our food  it is laughable. The veggies I got one time with my meal were 4 carrots. At times  it can be almost half the food. It's kind of funny because they think they have this big secret that you won't figure out....I eat at the restaurant so I know how much a serving size is there vs when you get take out  and the difference is ridiculous. I realize they are probably trying to save money  but they are losing my money because now I will only eat in the restaurant. Unfortunately  I don't really have time to do that so I just get food somewhere else.  Hopefully they will read this and it will change. I will try again in a few months to see if it's gotten better  but until then I'm only eating at the restaurant. It's just happened too many times.
Priscila C.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,119,3,1,5/30/2014,1.0,"Took my best friend here for her graduation dinner right after her graduation. We were meeting other people there who had gotten a table for us. We sat down and no server came over to our table for five minutes to get us drinks. I ordered a lemonade and everyone else got water and our server couldn\'t even remember who got the lemonade. Then she disappeared again for another five minutes  came back  and asked us if we wanted appetizers. We weren\'t even finished ordering when she started to walk away and I had to shout for her to come back. We then ordered our food and received it about 15 minutes after and I turned around and looked behind me and saw a cockroach!! So disgusting!! We told a server and he came over  climbed on the booth  and crushed it and said ""I hope you don\'t see anymore."" WHAT?! We shouldn\'t have even seen one!! Our server said she would send a manager right away. A man in a button up came over and just said ""so who saw something over here?"" Didn\'t introduce himself at all. Then he said ""sorry about that  hope you don\'t have to see anymore"" and walks away!!! Our server was so embarrassed and made him comp our of our entrees. What a horrible experience and terrible management."
Ryan F.,Round Hill  VA,1,17,2,8/10/2011,4.0,I've been here several times. Its a good place for pretty good beer and really good food. The happy hour deal is OK. Only a buck off per beer. As empty as it was they should may be half price to drum up more business.(Just a suggestion) The apps are $2 off and personal pizzas are half price. The pizzas are deep dish and are awsome. Meaghan was the bartender and she was great. Will be going back!
Chris O.,Glendale  CA,2,27,,7/30/2010,2.0,BJs isn't the kind of place you want to eat it every day. The prices are a bit high for the quality of food that you get. The service is so-so. You'll get your food  but you might have to wait awhile. And if you ask for extra tomatoes on your pizza  you might not get as many as you hoped for  but it'll still taste good. That said  I'd still go to BJs every once in a while if someone else in my party suggested it. I'd be game  'cause you can't ask for everything. EXCEPT that the last time I tried to go there for lunch with a friend  the valet guy wouldn't let me park my car on my own. This is a deal breaker. I've been to this BJs several times. The valet guys are usually totally cool. I don't know if BJs or the valet company changed their policy  or maybe I just got a dumb guy  but he said I absolutely had to valet park. So we left and ate somewhere else. And I won't be returning  because there are tons of other restaurants in Burbank that won't force me to valet park  and they have better food.
Cathy G.,Burbank  CA,293,204,56,12/3/2008,4.0,Back in the day  my ex and i used to frequent this place on a weekly basis. It was because of these frequent visits that I unabashedly gained 10lbs solely from the baked potatoes and their vast drinks menu. It came to a point where I found myself turning into potato  the carb intake in this place is criminal enough to make Richard Simmons commit murder. Since then  I've gained a new boyfriend and a better handle on my self control and limit my visits here to once every month or couple of months  depending on the Lakers game schedule. I've also gain a high tolerance of beer and everything carb related. I usually stick to my fail proof dishes -- the bbq/ranch chicken salad  the grilled burger melt  the crispy chicken  cuban burger  the blackened chicken potato  the great white pizza  and the bbq chicken pizza.Best beer yet is the Jeremiah Red mixed with Berry Cider. Jeremiah Red is also great by itself  as is the berry cider. As someone so kindly pointed out  pizzas are half off during Happy Hour 3-7pm. Appetizers are $2 off and I think it's $2 off the beer too(I'll have to check that). All so good. Damn  I think I just gained 5lbs writing this.
Felicia C.,Redwood City  CA,344,430,124,3/8/2008,3.0,Everyone's been to BJ's  blah blah blah. Who cares. I just gotta make a quick comment about their delivery service.The Burbank BJ's only delivers to places in Burbank  pretty much until you hit the production studios and such. Luckily  I worked in this area so BJ's was a great place when work was busy during the day and I didn't have time to drive over and pick up food.BJ's has this great thing where they print your order on labels and then attach said labels to the box so you always know what's what. These labels also say what you modified with the order  again  making life a whole lot easier when you're picking up food for busy  picky people.Maybe I'm just impressed by stupid things but those labels are awesome. ...And the food's decent too.
Kevin F.,Los Angeles  CA,196,172,4,10/13/2007,4.0,I've been to a few different BJs locations  but I have to say this one is my favorite. The food is pretty much the same  but the atmosphere is much better than the others I've been to. It is a big place  and generally busy in the evening. Even though it is crowded  since it is a big place the wait usually isn't very long. They have a bar area with open seating as well  so if there is an empty table there you can grab it. The food here has always been good. I've had the pizza  french dip  BBQ beef  meatloaf and probably a few other things I can't remember at the moment. The pizza is thick crust  which I'm a big fan of. The buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite. Nice and spicy and served with a side of ranch dressing. They have a good selection of appetizers (I've had the nachos  wings and chicken fingers  all good) and desserts. Their specialty dessert is the pizookie. Mmmmm...pizookie...a big warm cookie with ice cream on top.  They also serve a variety of microbrew and specialty beers. They have televisions showing sports throughout the restaurant so you can follow the games while you eat and/or drink (although you can't hear them because they're usually playing music). My only complaint with this BJs is the parking. You either have to valet park  which I'm against  or you have to drive up a 45 degree incline and fight for one of the limited spaces on top of the parking structure. One last note for the fellas  for some reason there are usually a lot of attractive women at this location.
Aimee S.,Whittier  CA,291,278,5,2/3/2007,2.0,"If it wasn\'t for my delicious Pizookie and my friend\'s Poison Apple (which I only tasted  but seriously  delicious)  this place would get NEGATIVE stars for its slow and crappy service. I hadn\'t been to a BJ\'s in a long time and when Maria called me up and said ""Pizookie"" I said ""what time"". Even though it was chilly outside  they had heaters on the patio and we were all starving so we said outside since the wait was less. Big mistake. We knew we were in trouble when we overheard our waiter tell the table next to us ""I\'m sorry  we\'re really busy"". No $h*t. Every restaurant on a Friday night is busy. No excuse for bad service.Anyway we ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls that just melt in your mouth. Yum. But our waiter sent some PMS-ing chick to tease us with them. She literally waved them in our drooling faces and said  ""Um  lemme check..."" and walked away. Evil wench. Luckily she came back and my friend said ""Are you back to tease us again?"" in an obvious joking manner. She responded again PMS-y ""Well I had to check otherwise I\'d get in trouble"". A few minutes later our order starts to come out. Again our waiter sends another stick-up-her-ass assistant who mumbles what she has and none of us understand so we ask ""What was that?"". She: SIGHS (!!!) and says ""BBQ Chicken Pizza and Calzone"". Oh. BBQ Chicken right here. Sheesh. And my BBQ Chicken Pizza was just okay. I prefer CPK\'s.  Also  Maria had what she called ""Berry Beer"" and it tasted...yucky. We all get our food and luckily having great conversation and having fun complaining about our shitty service. But when my friends try to order another round of their drinks (Cadillac Margs  yummy!  and the above mentioned Poison Apple) it took FOREVER. And he got the Poison Apple wrong. After what seemed like an hour after we asked for our check  he apologized for the poor service and complained that there was supposed to be 3 servers out on the patio but 2 had called out sick and he was left alone. Sorry  not our problem. They shouldn\'t have sat so many tables outside then! But yay $2.25 valet."
Alan P.,Granada Hills  CA,1,82,,10/11/2011,2.0,bottom line  this particular BJ's has some of the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant  particularly BJ's! Just had lunch there a couple of days ago  the restaurant was relatively empty and the waiters were running around acting like if they were actually busy. I have no idea how people with ridiculously bad customer service can actually work at restaurants. The food  same as usual  in fact I believe it to be rather mediocre for the prices they charge  beer was good  but even the bartender had an attitude problem.Pros: pizza  appetizers  beerCons: service  employees with horrible attitude problems
Chris U.,Santa Monica  CA,0,29,2,6/7/2011,3.0,5 stars service1 star food that is not pizza4 stars for the pizza and beerI have been here twice. First time got pizza and beer and everything was alright. Second time we got Nachos and Burgers. Worst ever. We actually sent it back for being served cold. Here I need to mention that the staff was super cool about it and tried to do everything they could to fix it  and for that I give them props. However  when the food was served again it was still not very good but we decided to just muscle through. So  if you go  GET THE PIZZA and you will be happy. DO NOT GET THE BURGER. Other info  portions are really big and the desserts look delicious but i have not ever had room leftover to try one.
Gregg F.,Los Angeles  CA,21,78,2,11/2/2007,1.0,Blerg... First thing's first  What has two thumbs and doesn't like BJ's? *points at self with both thumbs* THIS GUY!I really haven't ever LOVED BJ's Restaurant Brewery  but the beer has brought me back a few times. But this location is crap crap crap. After waiting somewhere in the vein of 30 minutes for our disinterested waiter to come take our drink order we knew we weren't in for a good day. 20 minutes after my girlfriend had received her cocktail I finally got my pint of beer and he took our food orders. So we were approaching an hour in the restaurant without so much as a sip of beer and not even a hint of some food.Here's a quick rundown of what happened thereafter. He returned with our appetizer and dinner at the same time. Okay  I'll let that pass. He didn't come back to our table until my girlfriend was pushing the somewhat warm lettuce of her salad around her plate with her fork out of frustration that we'd not been offered a pizookie yet. The Waiter kind-of threw down the check in the little folio and walked away without offering us dessert. Wow...I worked food service for almost 6 years and have never left a tip under 15% except this once. The service I was given justified my $0.47 tip made up of random coins from my pocket. Sorry dude  but food service just ain't your calling.
Ralph A.,Los Angeles  CA,16,25,,12/28/2010,3.0,Oh yeahhhh! A nice sit-down restaurant  way to go BJ's! Pizookie is probably my only favorite thing. Food was a bit pricey and it wasn't good as I expected it to be. Place was too crowded. I went with my friends and we were pretty loud at the place. No one noticed us because the place was loud as well. Hahahahah. The servers were friendly. I had removed 2 stars because it was just ehhh how do I say it.. plain. Yeah. The restaurant and food was too plain in my taste. Nothing really special. I think my family or neighbor can cook better food than this. Oh wait  the pizookie is good. YOU HAVE TO TRY THAT!
Arthur F.,Los Angeles  CA,347,52,7,8/2/2010,2.0,TOOK ME 25 YEARS TO GET A DRINK  terrible waitress  they comp'd the whole goddamn meal  woulda had a better time getting a route canal.
Andrea Z.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,6/30/2012,2.0,Love bjs! It was first at this location last night our waitress was terrible got our orders completely wrong. :(
megan m.,Burbank  CA,146,26,104,3/15/2008,4.0,YUMM YUMM YUMM!I crave Bj's weekly the chilli is the best  also love the beer sampler...Its great for watching the game too...sometimes the service could be a little better but thats the only negative....
Dan F.,Burlington  VT,1,25,,7/23/2013,2.0,Anybody who rates this as 4 or 5 stars is on crack or was plain out wasted. It's a chain with medicre food.
Joe D.,Burbank  CA,0,29,,5/4/2013,3.0,Great Pizza. Just make sure you instruct the waiter to tell the cooks to cover the pizza with toppings! For some reason they skimp big time on the toppings and you end up with a whole lot of dough. I will be writing the corp office in this regard.
Marcus S.,Altadena  CA,45,49,,7/4/2006,3.0,Party Pizookie.Thats really all that you need to know. And if you don't know what that means  well then let me educate you. Imagine a cookie so large that if sent into space it would disturb the tide and currents of our oceans.SO large that if placed in front of the sun  it rays would be blocked and would send our world into ice and darkness.SO EFFING LARGE  that if Rosie o' Donnell ate out the center she could use it as a hula hoop.Well i might be exagerating but a pizookie is a rather large cookie (freshly baked mind you) served with a generous helping of ice cream and more than enough sugar to keep you bouncing off the walls through all hours of the night.Other than that though? The food selection is only meh. Their pizza is great deep dish style  but very small  and very expensive. On the whole to me it dosen't seem like the price matches up to the food they serve. It's really one of those situations where you might end up paying like 9 bucks or something for spaghetti or 8 for a slice of pizza. While it should be noted that their food does taste really good (and the pizookie is quite possibly the 8th wonder of the world) the price is effing steep.
Jesse H.,Studio City  CA,1264,56,33,9/2/2006,4.0,I had heard great things about BJ's and decided to try it for lunch yesterday with a cousin. We each ordered the mini pizzas and man they were off the charts good. The atmosphere at this location is very much like any brewery/sports bar. 10+ tvs tuned to ESPN but without the sound on so you can carry on your own conversations. My cousin ordered a drink and it took three more requests for it before they brought it  so that's very odd because I ordered a ceaser salad with my meal and they brought that out promptly. For being a brewery you'd think they'd be more prompt with the beer. But it came during the main course so it's no big deal. The waitstaff is very friendly and the hostesses are cute too =).The place has items on the menu that make your mouth water whether you are on a diet or meat lover  vegetarian  or just stopping by for a snack or dessert. I wish there was a location closer to me in the south bay  but it's worth the drive.Enjoy!
Andy S.,Venice  CA,325,143,40,12/26/2006,4.0,"LA has a ridiculous shortage of bars that are ""showing-the-game "" which is  not necessarily to say ""sports bars.""In the year I\'ve been in LA I\'ve run up to BJ\'s several times to get my fix of Chicago Cubs and Bears action. Parking is free on the roof of the $2.50 valet lot. The beer is surprisingly good for a multi-venue moderately-chainy ""microbrewery."" -- they often have seasonal specials  although I\'m generally happy with the IPA.My favorite is the Roast Beef Dip  with half a gigantic baked potato. I\'ve always wanted to try the pizookie dessert (a cookie baked in a mini pan-pizza pan w/ ice cream)  but I seem to always end up here alone!Only 4 stars because they claim to have chicago style pizza  and their deep dish is far from the real deal (no big surprise here)."
Tina V.,Glendale  CA,0,6,,8/22/2013,3.0,We've always enjoyed BJ's and the food. Quality of service has started lacking  though. Our appetizer arrived and we didn't have silverware. Couldn't find our waiter for the longest time  so we asked another waiter for silverware. He disappeared as well  we then asked someone else. We continued waiting as our appetizer got cold. He should've noticed right off that we didn't have silverware/napkins on the table as he seated us! The stuffed mushrooms are yummy! Don't really care for their salads. Mediterranean pizza is delish!
Aisha C.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,84,4,,7/10/2013,1.0,First  the valet is not great service. They were like texting while helping us with our car. Second  it was a 15 minute wait to eat outside even though when we walked in we saw plenty of open tables. Third  my dad ordered the salmon and it smelled super gross and tasted awful. It looked like super undercooked or old or something  and the vegetables were cold. My brother's ribs were dry  and my potato was mediocre. The service took a long time to deliver the food too. Only good thing I can say about this place is the service but the food makes it not worth going.
Byron L.,Glendale  CA,27,14,,8/15/2011,5.0,My friend brought me here on a Sunday night and the atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. Cimmon was our server and was exremely attentive and welcoming. Our appetizer combo plate had run out of spring rolls and she quickly advised us and offered alternatives. No delays in food and our salads were delicious  great experience for a sunday night.
Emily C.,Inland Empire,2,264,,4/1/2007,3.0,The service was quite good. It was a little slow  but very friendly and accomodating. And when my calzone came out wrong  it wasn't entirely their fault... it turns out I ordered something that it was impossible for them to make. But so they sent me out another one  and it was the exact same thing with a little motzarella added. But the server made it all better when he gave us the drinks for free  didn't charge for my calzone  and then brought us a pazookie on the house. I didn't get my calzone  but I got a ton of free stuff  and since I am a certified freegan  that makes this dining experience Alright In My Book.Plus  I saw a couple of pretty funny things while I was here.1. A dude with super curly hair and then PERFECT eyebrows. Come on. You're not fooling anybody.2. We were sitting outdoors  and there was a lady who went in and out and in and out pretty much all night long. Near the end of the evening  I went in to utilize the ladies' room  and there she was again  going in  with one of her little friends! Is that really necessary? 3. The lady at the table next to us with a facial piercing  a short skirt  and an AWESOME laugh that made me giggle every time I heard it. Or maybe that was the berry cider talking. Laughing. Whatever.PS try the BBQ pizza.
Amanda N.,Los Angeles  CA,1,22,,7/17/2013,1.0,Terrible service  from a waiter who I guess didn't care that we weren't a celebrity  so he ignored us  to the BURNT PAZOOKIE! How the heck do you burn the best thing on the menu and then serve it?!?!? Shame!
Rhonda C.,Sylmar  CA,51,13,,2/11/2013,2.0,"I had eaten at BJ\'s once before - We were seated in an alcove at a large round table next to a door to the patio dining area. It was cold out (it was April) and the constantly opening door made it cold inside. It was not diners who were coming in and out  but employees - management could not be bothered to seat us elsewhere even though we asked. There was also an unpleasant smell. I ordered the Tuscany Pasta with grilled chicken that evening - what came was burnt chicken on a bed of pale angel hair pasta. There were pale tomatoes  which tasted acidy. To give credit  the waitress brought parma cheese  garlic salt  etc  immediately and exchanged the burnt chix for a fresh piece  so I figured it was a one time thing. Last night we had a family dinner  and ended up at BJ\'s. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer from one waitress who handed us off to another due to required breaks. She seemed to have it together and was very attentive and nice - we did not see her for the rest of the evening - we were there for 2 1/2 more hours. The second waitress seemed to be lack luster and apathetic - took our order and went along her way. It took almost 45 min for a third server to bring our soups (4 ordered soup - 3 soups arrived). He brusquely served us and when asked about the 4th soup  he said ""let me get your server"" and walked away. . .it was about 15 minutes before our server showed up and by that time the main course came out. When I asked about my soup she stared blankly and asked what kind of soup was it. . .she was not one of the two waitress serving the entree\'s and was just standing there. One of the other servers was bubbly and apologized and explained the kitchen ran out and was making more!!! But by that time I didn\'t want it - why would I? my main entree was there!!! My entree was Tuscan angel haired pasta and remembering what happened the last time  I ordered it with grilled salmon. It was burnt to a crisp!!!! I immediately called it to the servers attention and she again stood there. The thin blond bubbly one whisked it away immediately and said it would be fixed. I was hungry and annoyed!!! The manager came over and kept asking if I wanted the soup. Of course not - I just want my food already!!! but he insisted I wanted the soup  so I would have soup!!! The main entree came back out within 5 min  salmon was perfect this time  but pasta was missing peppers and pine nuts. . .I decided enough was enough and asked Apathetic waitress for garlic - she left and came back to ask whether whole or powder. . .Bubbly girl came back and gave me both. Manager came again to say he was sorry  and offered a couple of deserts for free. Great - my choices were pizookies with ice cream and a berry crumble with ice cream. Apathetic waitress came back to take our dessert order - my children asked her regarding anything sugar free for desserts - She said ""ice cream"". When my kids said  no - she is diabetic  anything else - Apathetic girl turned and walked away. Then turned around  said ""i\'ll ask the manager"" and walked away. Bubbly blond girl served us the one dessert we did order. We never saw the manager again and when I tried to get Apathetic servers attention  she was in the middle of a group of servers  wildly waving her hands  while the other servers ackwardly glanced in our direction. Finally she brought the bill and never came back for it. I don\'t think we will ever visit again. . ."
Gina Q.,Whittier  CA,17,705,136,10/3/2007,4.0,There's nothing like coming to BJ's to get some yummy salads and take in the sports bar atmosphere. After an afternoon at the Ellen show  we came here in an attempt to avoid the after work traffic on the way home.We had already partook of some Pink's hot dogs  so we were feeling like we needed to eat something light. My friend ordered the Santa Fe Salad. She thought the portions of her chicken were appropriate and really loved the thick avocado slices. I ordered the BBQ chopped salad. It was very tasty. Any salad with black beans and I'm there. The lettuce was finely chopped. It reminded me of how California Pizza Kitchen chops their salads. You get plenty of lettuce in addition to the toppings. Nicole G. is correct in saying that the salads are huge. Our server was attentive and did a great job as the amount of people increased inside the restaurant.If this B.J.'s was near me  I would come here again. Although  I would make mental note of the small amount of self-parking in the area. There is a parking garage for the restaurant  but it also shares spaces with a nearby business. If you get here during the dinner rush  I would probably recommend the valet parking available.

Moriah R.,Burbank  CA,3,20,,12/22/2012,3.0,i think its stupid that they charge you parking. the steak is way to expensive. black angus steak is cheaper and bigger and BETTER TASTING. food is ok but to pricey for the taste.

(the refills aren't free tho for the RB)It gets crowded around dinner time and on the weekends so be aware you might have to wait.***edit 2/4/08I just went here last night and the waitress was insane. She said she was going to spit in our food  (jokingly) but what waitress says that?? We got our spinach dip and it had a hair in it!!We ordered pitchers of beer and they took 4802938403 hours. Needed some lemon for our Hef's and that took 8402934 hours and we were sitting 2 ft from the bar so my friend just got up and got them. The baked potatoes ARE TERRIBLE. It was barely baked and really sick. It seems hard to screw up a baked potato but it happened here! I love BJ's Brewery  but last night made me sad! The blackened salmon was good though...so they lucked out w/ that.
Z Z.,Los Angeles  CA,63,575,67,5/8/2007,4.0,I have been to Bj's a bunch of times. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but I will go with 4..... :) I always get the same thing: Santa Fe Salad and the Brew House Nachos (w/o the chili). Its funny  almost everyone I know that goes there gets the Santa Fe Salad....it is delicious. I get the blackened chicken on the side (i am a vegetarian) and then give it to Paul bk you aren't charged less getting meatless. Paul got the Pizookie last night and I had a bite.......WOW  it was fantastic......it was so sweet and omg  it was great. Back to the nachos though  they are SO good and they give you so much food  I always have like two meals of leftovers. Same thing with the salad  it is huge! Oh  the have dinner rolls that they will bring you with the salad but you have to ask them.......The cons.......service is SLOW  especially is you get take-out. Parking is the PITS.....and it is frustrating that they don't charge you less for the meatless stuff. Plus  it is almost always crowded there  expect a 10-15 minutes wait even for a Monday evening. But  the food is consistently good  large portions  pretty big menu  lots of veggie options  and the bar area is fun and lively. Lots of tv's to check out whatever games are on....if that is you thing! :) (We sat with our backs to the tv bk Paul didn't want to see the score of the game....not sure what gave but.......he was stressed about it!)
Scott G.,Los Angeles  CA,102,133,27,2/24/2009,4.0,Love this place. Really good deep dish pizza that's hearty. Burgers come on like a kaiser roll or something and are delish. The beer is great  and also the Root Beer is awesome and they brew that themselves too. We've never had to wait that long for a table here even on the weekend  and it's a great place to go to have dinner while there's a Lakers game on  lots of energy then! Also they give you a free pizookie (deep dish cookie topped with ice-cream) on your birthday  its sooooo good! Not a place to go if you're on a diet  but that's what the gym is for!
Alicia A.,Temecula  CA,0,1,,12/17/2012,1.0,this is honestly the WORST service i have ever received at a restaurant...my roommates and i LOVE the food  but the service is just crap!the first time we came  the waitress NEVER came by  took forever with our food  didn't care to ask if we needed anything  we had to track her down just for refills... terrible!then the latest time we went was the WORST ever! first  i ordered a mini pizza because i have gotten those before  and they are filling for a mini and usually very delish! this tiny piece of crap came on a plate  which the waitress threw down and the cheese wasn't even on the damn pizza and no sauce at ALL and it was just shit for 8 bucks! so pissed. the server was AWFUL she never came to ask if we needed anything or if everything was fine... i didn't receive silverware of a napkin.. wtf. so i asked and she just brought me drink napkins  what the hell?! meanwhile we wanted to order dessert  and she was too busy talking about stupid crap with the table next to us.. we were pissed. so she finally comes and says dessert? and we say yes. no menu or anything she just starts saying 'double fudge  chocolate chip' and we were like uhhh... she was like telling us the names of the pizzookies  which was what we wanted but it was the matter of the fact.. anyway we order and right away she brings us a bill! ARE YOU KIDDING? so rude and we couldn't even ask to split  so we did and then she brought it back but we didn't even finish yet! then we were done and waiting  meanwhile she still didn't bring back a refill for my friend and then we brought it up  and 10 mins later we get back the wrong thing! SERIOUSLY? so shitty  took forever to take our bill and charge us.. and then when she did she took forever doing that! which makes me feel like she was doing something else also..... ill be checking my bank account since i read another review they took account info.. (last time i payed cash) no tip either times!never going back there again. only reason for that location is because its the closest... BAD!
tron d.,Nashville  TN,51,58,39,1/7/2009,1.0,Well  the beers were terrible. I believe that the taps are not clean or somewhere in the brew room there is some unsanitary conditions. I ordered the 4 beer sampler (Blonde  Pale  Stout  and Nut Brown) and all 4 of the beers carried the same nasty sweetly-bitter odor and taste. The stout seemed to suffer the most. Underneath that mask of off-flavor was a beer undoubtedly  but to get through to it was too much to ask. I only finished one of the 4 flute samplers (the blonde) and did my best to accomplish that. My food was decent but I believe I would've been more satisfied with IN N OUT. I had the Turkey Cobb and crispy fries which were stale. I would not recommend the BJ's in Burbank.
joseph s.,Los Angeles  CA,16,170,1,11/22/2009,3.0,Your typically BJ's. It's food & drinks are pretty much the same  but this place tends to get really packed  especially when I go here. The parking is okay and the restaurant is just right down the street from the mall and the AMC 16. Overall  its is surround by other competitors  such as elephant bar  islands  black angus  fudruckers  and many more. But if your looking for some pizza and drinks  then this is not a bad place to hit up.
Buck M.,LAKE VIEW TER  CA,1,44,2,4/8/2012,4.0,Normally service here isn't too hot. However lunch just now with a party of twelve WOW. All food came out together all was great refills on the spot no waiting. No one sent food back for any reason. Loved it. Waiter was David  Ask for him he's great and worth it if u have to wait.
Sarah S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,,6/20/2012,3.0,I really only come here for the pizookie!!! A pizookie is any type of cookie (i prefer chocolate chip) with any type of ice cream on top (i prefer vanilla). The chocolate chip cookie is always fresh out of the oven and the chocolate chips are almost melting!!! Yummy!!!! The food is ok. I like to get the burger. It's really big and the prices are fair. Service is good and they have AMAZING drinks. It's a solid restaurant.
Ange N.,La Canada Flintridge  CA,0,1,,6/14/2010,5.0,Geate food and atmospher  when you are out with girls  it is a perfect place. We had there plates to share  good size portiones and good price.Staff very frendly.Deffenetly will be back again.
Nicole O.,Burbank  CA,11,42,8,12/15/2005,4.0,Pizookie Cookie  YO! It's a gigantic (maybe not so gigantic) fresh out-of-the-oven cookie served with french vanilla ice cream. I always order the chocolate chip and macadamia cookie. It's a cool hang out spot - watch basketball games  sit outside and order pitchers of your favorite brew - and all that jazz. And  try the BJ's favorite for your chicago deep dish style pizza.
Hannah T.,Monrovia  CA,88,180,4,9/4/2008,3.0,"Our friends and I will not forget our waiter Jeremy. He took care of us 110% when we told him our food came out cold. We ordered ribs  chicken  steak  crispy pizza  Caesar salad and of course pizookie. He quickly fixed the problem even though the place was super packed!! When we saw our bill  we had to double check with everyone at our table that the amount was right. We asked Jeremy that he made a mistake but he said ""that\'s the correct amount."" We left him a fat a$$ tip."
Jonathan H.,Burbank  CA,3,13,,3/24/2011,2.0,This is based purely on this visit  gauging from other reviews I just got the wrong thing. I ordered the Classic Turkey Sandwich on multigrain bread. It looked good. The bread wasn't too fresh  a little on the hard and dry side. I thought I could choke it down  but couldn't. The wedge fries were delicious. Instead of sending it back and making my lunch complicated  I asked for some fresh bread. They brought the same stale bread and didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with it. Manage apologized and took it off the bill. My problem is that they just brought the same stale bread and that the kitchen staff doesn't seem to know what stale is or they just don't care.
tina d.,North Hollywood  CA,0,32,,11/18/2008,1.0,Go somehwere else (especially with all the better choices nearby).Everytime we go...staff is not at all concerned with getting our order right or giving you a good experience. Last time we went  we had a family (with kids) with us. We got a lot of bad attitude from our waitress -- it's quite common for families to EAT here...
M o.,Cathedral City  CA,0,10,,3/28/2010,3.0,I've been to BJ's in Maui several times and always love it. I've been to this location twice now. Pizza is great  but expensive for what you get. I can eat 1/2 a large by myself. What used to be a medium pizza is now a large at many places now days. Even though they're busy  the wait is short because they have lots of seating.  Good place for groups and teenagers. They loose a star because they only vacuum the middle of the floors and apparently never dust.  They loose another star because my beer was skunky. The tap lines needed to be cleaned out. Bad management.
Efy M.,Encino  CA,0,54,,12/27/2009,3.0,Food is decent  but attempting self parking is a pain. The ramp is REALLY STEEP so be careful. If a car is coming down  make sure you let them go down before you attempt to go up the ramp. It wasn't made for two way traffic. If you have a large SUV  good luck trying to do a three-point turn because it doesn't loop around. once you reach any end of the parking  you have to do a three-point turn to come back around. The service was okay. We wanted to get seated sooner  so we sat outside. It wasn't as loud as the inside so that was nice  but we couldn't watch any of the games. Our waitress didn't come outside much  so our water cups were empty for a while. The food was good. Not the best I've ever had  but still good. We had the artichoke pizza and a yummy pzookie. One medium pizza for three girls was just the perfect amount for us and let us have some room for their famous pzookie. Overal  it was just okay. If I'm in the mood for BJ's and I'm in the area  I'll come back  but it's not a place I'm desperate to come back and try again.
David B.,Sherman Oaks  CA,4,1,,11/30/2009,5.0,I was only there for the pizza  because a friend had said it was good. The SPINACH & ARTICHOKE PIZZA:A rich  creamy medley of spinach  artichoke hearts  cream cheese and mozzarella topped with our fresh tomato basil blend and Parmesan cheese. It was delicious!As far as the service  the waiter was a little slow  but did not have to wait long for seating.
Chance G.,Los Angeles  CA,360,44,1,5/23/2008,3.0,I always order the beer battered fish and chips...because I like to get my fish drunk  and then take advantage of them.
Rod R.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,4,8,,7/28/2009,5.0,Freakin LOVE! this place...my favorite place!...pizza is the best! the chicken wings are great...great beer! recommend the Jeremiah red. Ive been to about three bj's locations and this one by far has been the best...mainly location scene  and service!
David T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,7/30/2007,5.0,"What can be said about BJ\'s?It\'s just a great resteraunt. It\'s got a cozy atmosphere  (once you\'re actually seated)  and friendly service. Really  they don\'t get mad when you keep changing your order!Food is great too. If it\'s your first time there  I recommend the Meatball Sub. It tastes fresh and juicy  and you can really taste the sauces. BJ\'s also boasts the best desert in the entire world. It\'s the kind of thing that you plan your meal around. It\'s not  ""If I have room I will order it."" It\'s  ""I probably won\'t have room for it if I order a sandwich...I\'ll have a salad instead.""It\'s called a pizzookie  and it is a perfect mix of hot brownie and vanilla ice cream  topped with fudge and (optionally) oreos chunks.If you see this resteraunt as you drive by  stop."
C S.,Glendale  CA,20,48,4,6/2/2010,2.0,"I went here a few months ago and we ordered a pizza. It was ok  nothing I would really care to experience again. Also ordered their single serving of rootbeer. Tasty I guess  but nothing special. Notice they now have a B rating  just shows that Burbank is Not the place to be find a good meal. What is really nasty about their new rating is one of the violations was  ""DISEASE TRANSMISSION - CARRIER / WOUND"" Obviously the ratings do not go into exact detail  but that alone would scare me away from ever going back."
Chuck D.,Studio City  CA,103,226,4,3/8/2009,2.0,This is a place that I remember being a disaster from start to finish. The service was terrible  probably the worst roast beef sandwich I ever tasted and the bruschetta ...not the place for it...but why even have it on the menu. Just gross. The highlight was the beers on tap and the big screen tv's and of course having a hot date. Would never go back. 66/100
Steven F.,Highland Park  Los Angeles  CA,2,2,,12/22/2009,5.0,We go to BJ's for the great pizza  beer  and service. Our server Steve is always fast and makes us feel at home. Definitely go to BJ's if you like deep dish pizza  they can do thin crust too  but not is the medium and large sizes. Try a pizzookie too!
Annie T.,Burbank  CA,0,19,,10/25/2011,4.0,I really like this place for their burgers and garlic fries! Good place to go with friend for relaxing atmosphere. Servers really pleasant and nice.
Jill A.,Covina  CA,736,493,149,11/25/2007,4.0,did someone say happy hour? bj's brews and cider- $1.00 offmini pizzas - 50% offappetizers - $2.00 offwell drinks - $2.75i had the sweet pig pizza  2 jerry burst (jeremiah red + berry burst cider - YUM!)  and a soco and lime shot. it was definitely a HAPPY HOUR! :)
Ferdinand M.,Los Angeles  CA,50,118,1,6/30/2008,3.0,I know this place is a total chain  and I usually avoid chains if at all possible  but I think BJ's is solid. Good selection of house-made  draft beers.. Good Hefeweizen.. The food is a definite step up from your standard brew pub burgers and wings place too and they step it up a little by giving you the club sandwich on some kind of garlic toast or something as opposed to just normal bread. It's the little things like that.. Just a vast selection of things that taste really good and are incredibly bad for you and a nice variety of house brewed beer to wash it down with. I would give it four stars  but honestly the sports bar and Nickelback & Creed on the radio vibe bums me out.
Lee R.,Playa del Rey  CA,12,51,4,8/3/2007,4.0,I happened across BJ's after my second trip of the day to IKEA for some house furniture. We couldn't fit everything during our first run  so we went right back for more. Well after that fiasco I definitely needed a nice cold beer  and since LA lacks brewpubs whenever I see one I feel obligated to check it out. Let me tell you friends...the beer is FANTASTIC. We started with the 7-beer sampler  very reasonably priced at $8.50 considering the samples are 5 oz. glasses. First was a Kolsch-style blonde ale  light and refreshing but still retaining a nice hop bitterness. Next was a bavarian style hefeweizen  strong aroma of banana and cloves. No lemon needed! Then a Pale Ale  beautifully balanced and delightfully hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops. Then came a red strong ale  tipping the scales at 7.3% ABV. Surprisingly smooth for a beer of that strength. Next was the PM Porter  served on Nitro to give it a super creamy texture and head like Guinness. Yum. After that was the Tatonka Stout  an Imperial Stout (8.3%ABV) that was deliciously intense. Finally their seasonal was a Nut-Brown ale I think. By that point my tastebuds were thoroughly worked over. I would order any of those beers again  and it's not often I say that about a brewpub's offerings.Food was 2-3 stars  we tried the lettuce wraps and a mini pizza (the works) for about $8.50 each. Nothing to write home about  but I'll definitely be back to try more. The pizookie sounds awesome  getting that next time for sure.
Nelson P.,North Hollywood  CA,18,23,,4/5/2010,2.0,Dude this spot was a disappointment  the food was simple... In taste.. I expected the presentation to be bland. Well let's say the place is pretty inviting and when I went it was full so I expected good things. Took about ten minutes for us to be asked for drinks and another 7 to get them. I started off by ordering the fried calamari an when they brought it over it looked appetizing  but it was disappointing. It tasted like they just dredged the pieces in flour and fried them in some funky old oil. Now where I work we season the flour for the calamari. Then I ordered the balsamic grilled chicken thing and when I got it again same thing  looked appetizing smelled good   but no flavor. Once I got through that I dared to go for the brownie  and let me tell you  it HAD flavor!!!! Yaaaaay I thought to myself  but as I kept going for more I found out that I was in for some archeological findings as I had to chisel away at the edges to get the caked on parts of the brownie. All in all this place was to much money for what they give you. The food was bland and I noticed that most of their desserts are served in the same five inch cake pans so I have a feeling they don't even make the batter for the brownie  but order it pre-made so they just pour it into the pan and microwave that B. So now I know why it's a brewhouse too  so you get drunk of what I hear is good beer and don't notice how tasteless their food is. Not going back here no more son!
Angela H.,Burbank  CA,0,14,2,6/20/2009,5.0,I L-O-V-E this place i mean great service great food awesome desserts the flat screens r pretty awesome too but i was from a distance so i couldnt really tell... but  i would definitly go back there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Martin A.,Burbank  CA,2,42,,12/13/2010,3.0,Wait is sometimes longer than it should be and if you get a crappy waiter/waitress then its very annoying  otherwise the food is great and the atmosphere is top notch for a brewhouse. nice place to catch a game. Biggest problem is parking.. Although there are MANY open parking spots available  they still insist on making you park far if you self park because they try to get you to valet the car. This would make a lot more sense if it was needed but its obvious the valet is just set up to annoy people
Shawna M.,Los Angeles  CA,15,3,,6/13/2011,3.0,The food is okay and the Beer is GREAT
Terra O.,San Fernando Valley  CA,6,39,,11/13/2010,5.0,Never a disappointment  always a treat! When in doubt get a pizza  that's always a favorite. We love the 2 for $20 deal!
Michelle O.,Thousand Oaks  CA,248,785,341,9/3/2006,4.0,This place is fairly good  they have a good selection of food. They have salads  which i recommend the BBQ chicken salad  o so good and it's filling. They also have pizza  sandwiches  won tons  these massive baked potatoes that sometimes people just get those for lunch and they come w/ different topings. So as you can see if they have good variety. This is the somewhat new place that many younger people like to hangout at  teenage-20 somethings. This place stays open til around 10 on week days and around 12ish on weekends. You can say this is the replacement of the Chili's hangout. Though when it gets towards the evening it can get pretty loud in there. Not only do they have great food but they have a bar as well that you can sit at anytime and tablesin the bar area (of age for drinks) and don't have to wait for sitting. Back to the food they have a great dessert (basically the only dessert) it's called a a pazookie. It's good  basically it's ice cream and a cookie  whether you prefer chocolate chip  oatmel etc. They also have the party platter that my friends and I got  which it contains 4 different types of cookies as well as ice cream. This place can get very crowded so as we suggestion  especially if you are a family or a big group of people  make sure you go to a early dinner  b/c this place get's busy. The only time it's not TOO bad it at lunch during the weekdays. Also the one in oxnard is just the same  and the service there is good as well. But again it gets busy and you can be waiting around dinner 6-7+ pm from 1/2 hr. on  sometimes 15-20 min. So grab some good friends and a pazookie platter and you're good to go!
ariel p.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,5/5/2009,1.0,Never having been to a B.J.'s  yesterday was the night to go for the first time.We ordered drinks (one very tasty and hoppy Piranha Pale Ale  one nice Daiquir) and some nachos to nibble while deciding what to eat. The drinks and the nachos appeared - a huge platter overflowing with nachos and chili.By huge I mean - there was enough food on it to feed a family of four. Honestly. So that's all we ate.Apart from that - the place is huge and very  very noisy. It probably would be fun to go there with a group to add to the din. So I actually can't rate B.J.'s. I'll first have to get a group together to come with me.
R J.,Glendale  CA,0,13,,5/3/2011,5.0,I love the deep dish pizza here  the mushroom-spinach appetizers  and the pazookie is great. A great place for a get-together.
Josh A.,Burbank  CA,43,60,2,6/7/2008,4.0,The pizza is very tasty  but this place is always packed so expect the service to be a little slower than you'd like.
Dennis T.,Los Angeles  CA,309,213,5,6/25/2007,4.0,7 piece sampler is all I gotta say. 8 bucks  and BOOOM I'm pretty nice and crunk. LOL. I'm such weak sauce. Remember to drink them from the darkest brew to lightest brew. In my opinion it makes it a lot easier to drink and enjoy. Food wise  all the typical bar foods. Mini pizzas are great  especially during happy hour. Those who eat at BJs and decide not to have a pizookie should be jailed. When they ask you what kind of cookie you want  for those who don't know  you can do half and half. Half chocolate chip  half white chocolate. BOOM!
Joshua L.,Sun Valley  CA,5,17,,3/23/2011,4.0,i want to thank jamie the manager of the restaurant for helping us . we ordered our food about 5:45pm and it took about 1 hour to receive it. she help us by making sure we received our appetizer first and food after we were done. she also gave us a free drink which was greatly appreciated. i appreciate that she stood up for the company and showed it cared for it's customers. thanks again jamie.
Tracy S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,,11/24/2010,4.0,You gotta have a pazookie. OMG.. delicious. Great deep dish pizza too.
Mac F.,Alhambra  CA,0,32,,10/11/2010,4.0,stopped by today for lunch at 11:45am... sat in the bar area with friends who wanted to go to BJs... first off the service was good (i read several bad service reviews on yelp)... i ordered my drink first as I looked over the menu... the drink came quickly and I decided on mac n' cheese and chicken teriyaki... mac n' chesse came at the same time as the others salads did... the mac was good not great but passable... my chicken teriyaki was very good  the chicken was over rice grilled onions and peppers which made it very tasty... I will be returning to BJs in the near future...
J S.,South Pasadena  CA,12,101,1,2/20/2008,4.0,Its a sportish like bar/restaurant. Cool place to bring your friends  not some dark  nasty old beer smelling place.Went there for dinner with a friend  not for a game. Screens were on  not the sound  you can sit at a real table and have good grub  or you can sit at a bar table and drink. I'm sure on game day  it must be crazy cool  lots of space.If you are a sports boy and your girl wants you to take her out  you'll both be happy at this place.Staff was very friendly and patient too.Tip: You don't need to valet park. Go up the parking  and park at the top. Also  entrance is only from First Street.
D T.,Baldwin Park  CA,17,51,2,12/19/2009,5.0,good beer! good food! good games! gooood times!...at times toooo good! the old bartenders are all gone tho so it's not the same..Jeremy  Matt  and Sarah---u guys made the best drinks!..Sergio..Gonzalo..you guys were da best therapist!..thanks for the awesome nights! -Dino&Linda
kate q.,Seattle  WA,0,27,,9/1/2007,5.0,I'm giving this a five star review but you HAVE to sit at the bar okay? Otherwise it's a 3 on a good day. The interior is a corporate nightmare but sitting the bar  you'll never notice. The service SUCKS but the bartenders serve you food quick and with a smile. The beer is some of the best we've ever had and that holds true no matter where you sit. The food is good too and fairly prices. AND if you sit at the bar  it comes up pretty quickly. If you don't sit at the bar  you must sit inside because if you sit outside they will forget about you =(.
Sarah S.,San Luis Obispo  CA,9,27,,7/24/2009,4.0,I love Bj's oh yes I do. I love this location just cuz Burbank is a cool place. Start off with strawberry lemonade  ventured off from my usual order of root beer.. The spinach dip is usually a hit or miss for me but tonight was a sure hit cuz it was cheesy  gooey  spinach-y and the tortilla chips were crunchy. I try to get different dishes everytime I go anywhere and tonight I was in the mood for salmon and tried the Salmon plate (blackened  of course) and it was quite tasty. The peppered seasoning was not so overwhelming like other places and the steamed veggies were the right consistency. Okk enough bout the food (which are always tasty don't get me wrong) but I can not  I repeat  I CANNOT go to BJ's without getting a pizzookie. I dont care if Im stuffed  full and on the verge of puking from eating  I dont care  because its a definite must. It's like a freshly baked oversized chocolate chip cookie and scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. It sounds plain and simple  but when you take a bite of that cookie with ice cream  its pure bliss in your mouth. I salivate just thinking about it. =)
Eric G.,West Newton  MA,1,20,,10/26/2009,4.0,Had a great lunch here yesterday. Yummy fish tacos. Very atttentive service
Caitlin B.,Phoenix  AZ,0,5,,6/12/2009,5.0,BJ's just started serving these new Flatbread Appetizer Pizza's that are out of this world. The food their is soooo good but the flatbreads are the best appetizer by far!!!!
Mark F.,La Crescenta  CA,1,28,,3/25/2007,4.0,You can't go wrong with the food and drinks at BJ's. The humongous multi-screen TV with multiple games going on at a time is by far the best feature inside. Pizzas  and appetizers are all excellent. Go with the microbrew sampler  you won't be disappointed. Always a happening vibe in there  usually never have to wait too long even though its that busy. Only downside  there is a major lack of good-looking female wait staff. Go to Valencia if you want that. It's all dudes who work at this one.
J L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,75,1,3/14/2008,4.0,a cool place to go with a group of friends for some good pizza...the spinach/artichoke dip is pretty good too and their PIZOOKIE's are to die for!!!
