Jim F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,,3.0,10/22/2012,"Great food, great drinks for the price but poor management. Bartenders run around like spasmatics and floor manager does nothing to help. Calling out a waiter or bus boy in front of customers bad form too, but maybe Justin and Jimmy can get a third body back there on Saturday Nights during football and service will improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5?start=20
Justin P.,"Sparta Township, NJ",0,23,,2.0,5/4/2014,Got a bacon cheeseburger here and it was just not good.  Bacon was limp and soggy.  Burger was greasy.  Fries were good but that's about it.  Better options in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5?start=20
Sober L.,"Novato, CA",2,118,,4.0,8/1/2013,"i loved this joint.  right across the parking lot from my hotel, it was convenient and food was great. i didnt have any bad meals there.  The staff was fantastic.  it was very clean. one of the nights I was there, a girls softball team was there and they were so much fun to hear.  it's that kind of place.  joyful, tasty food and a good bargain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5?start=20
Phillip B.,"Dover, NJ",49,245,267,3.0,8/27/2010,"Amazing that I have eaten at Applebees twice in a week. I am not a huge fan of their menu, but usually can find something I will eat. The food came out pretty fast and all our special requests were correct (Mom and Dad were with me and they are the King and Queen of Confusion). The server was quick and she did check on us to make sure we had soda. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5?start=20
Matthew B.,"Ocala, FL",5,6,,5.0,12/15/2011,"I love Applebees! The carside-to-go is an amazing service, and makes picking up food easy and hassle-free. There aren't many things I've tried on the menu, due to my medical addiction to their chicken fingers, but whenever I see the waiters walk by with other food, it all looks good too! The service can slow down when it gets busy (makes sense...), but they're always all very nice! They open the doors for you and greet you (I'm sure this is customary for Applebees everywhere, but it's still a nice gesture) and typically seat you relatively quickly. I have not yet tried any of their desserts, but they look to die for. As far as chain restaurants go, this is my favorite one in Newton, and if I'm ever traveling, I'll know Applebees is failsafe!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5?start=20
Clare C.,"Denver, CO",0,1,,5.0,1/1/2018,"To say that our experience at Applebee's was amazing would be an understatement!  The staff was great (will get into that later) and the $1 Long Islands + Half Priced Apps left nothing to be desired.   I would recommend this Applebees specifically above all other Applebees because of the supreme management there.  Chris, our waiter and GM, was sure to make us feel welcome our entire stay. At the end of our meal (around closing time) we realized that we did not have a safe means of transportation home. Chris went above and beyond to help us figure out a solution and at the end of the night 4 women made it home safe and sound.   We will be making the trip from NYC to this Applebees again and again.  I speak for everyone at our meal when I say that we feel apart of the Applebees family. Hope to pay forward Chris' good deed soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Sarah S.,"Milford, PA",66,2,,2.0,12/29/2017,"The food is just the same food as every other apple Bees. But the service is AWFUL! super rude. I am a waitress so i get service and you should approach the table 2 minutes within sitting down. It took 20 minutes for her to come over. Then she took our order, another server brought our food out and our server never came back. Until she brought the check, and tried our gift card and said ""it's not working go ask a manager"" and said that as she is walking away!!!! WTF LOL it was actually pathetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Niki B.,"Franklin, NJ",0,11,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Poor service, food is bland and not consistent. Staff should not be working and eating they're lunch at the bar in plain sight. Dirty dirty place.

Al L.,"NJ, NJ",1,25,5,5.0,8/3/2016,I was waited on by Jeanette yesterday. She was friendly and fast. I got everything I asked for with a smile. Applebees food is always solid. I recommend this place.

Brian M.,"Orrington, ME",0,15,7,1.0,10/22/2015,"Absolutely awful...... Service was crappy and management doesn't seem to care. Typical chain restaurant with the typical shitty help.

Chris C.,"Andover, NJ",3,174,1733,5.0,12/12/2015,"We had an excellent meal today at Applebee's in New Jersey. They are always very good with customer service at the point of entry, but... the entire place has a wonderful Christmas vibe.. tree, stocking hanging in the bar, great job Applebee's! Very comforting and really gets you in the spirit of good will to ALL! Our server was Holly, very nice friendly and informative.  She recommended ""oriental chicken salad"" which was great! My date selected ""three cheese penni"" which came out hot and tasty! Plenty to take home from both for a later meal. I don't favor chains but this Applebbees has always been at the top. Thanks again, Holly, you made this special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Lisa D.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",1,3,,4.0,9/30/2014,"On the way from the Poconos to NJ, the 1st place we stopped to eat decided to ignore us standing there waiting to be seated, so we left in search to find someplace to eat. Applebee's to the rescue!  We decided to have the 2 for 20. The boneless wings were great, and the portion was pretty large. For the main meal I had the quesadilla burger (my go-to dish every time I come here) and my bro got a chicken pasta something or other, which he enjoyed. We each left some of our meal to save room for dessert. We each got a chimichanga cheesecake (is that the name?) that came with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious!  Our waitress (Katherine I think) was great...come by enough to ensure our meal was correct, but not so many times that she was a bother.  If I was in the area again, I would return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Kathryn R.,"Kissimmee, FL",2,1,,1.0,5/13/2015,"I am not one to complain at restaurants if my food is not flavorful or even undercooked. However, my husband and I ate here tonight and the bun for my burger had MOLD on it! I asked for a new bun. In return, i didn't even get an apology, let alone an offer of free burger or dessert on the house. The manager brought the new one over and just said ""here's your new burger"". Horrible customer service. Needless to say, we will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
April B.,"Newton, NJ",37,90,12,4.0,4/8/2014,I have been here a few times now. They are always busy as it's one of the few places to go near by.  The staff has always been super nice to me.  Last time I was there we had a big group of people go and they were really great to accommodate all of us. The food is always what you expect and the managers usually check in with you if you eat inside. The curb side service is nice as well the staff is quick to get your food out and get you on your way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5

Charlee D.,"Atlantic City, NJ",362,199,203,3.0,2/5/2013,"What happens when you put 25 20-somethings in a hotel, in a town with more bears than people, for 2 weeks, with an Applebees in the parking lot? By our last night, the staff here either loved us or hated us. I didn't actually eat at this Applebees, but I drank them out of Firefly, and I was here pretty much 10 times in 14 days, so I think I'm qualified to review.  This was our after-hours meeting spot after a grueling day of insurance and group meals. I found the staff to be friendly, especially the bartenders, but not everyone in my group had the same experience. While sitting in the bar area at a table, one of my coworkers asked our waitress for a glass of water, and she told him he'd have to go up to the bar to get it...? No wait, I lied. I ate a boneless buffalo wing off the plate of a guy I'd known for a week. He OFFERED. I really think Applebees makes the best boneless buffalo wings, and I really don't care how many grams of fat are in them.  The male bartender (I forgot his name I'm sorry!) gave us some good insights on where to eat and get drinks. I think he gave me a free drink too.  Also my coworker and I lost a bet to a group of Michiganders (Lions beat the Eagles) so we had to do push-ups in here. I did 10, he had to do 50. We literally got down on the floor in the middle of the restaurant and did push-ups. Again, the staff was super cool and just stood around watching us.  BUT THE BEST experience here was when a woman, I'd say in her early-to-mid-20s came in by herself for a glass of wine and a blondie. She was at the table behind our group and the boys decided it would be hilarious to call her over and chat her up. Long story short, this girl ends up singing songs from The Little Mermaid to us while staring at me like a crazy person. She sure was a class act. I will always have fond memories of this Applebees!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Kara L.,"Jersey City, NJ",154,68,18,1.0,11/17/2012,"After 3 consecutive bad experiences, I am finally writing a review. I've been to at least 10-15 other Applebee's restaurants in NJ and other states, and this one is easily the worst. In the interest of not making this a novel I'll just recap the most recent visit, curbside pick up at 5:15 on a Saturday evening.  We ordered two different steak dinners. They were both ungodly dry, salty, over seasoned and challenging for even the sharpest steak knives. They were accurately cooked to medium rare, yet the texture suggested that they may have been microwaved to get there. I may have simply chalked this up to a symptom of poor quality meat at a mediocre chain restaurant if I hadn't tried the steak at so many of their other locations-it was never anywhere near this bad.  Further, We asked for extra mushrooms on a dish that already comes with them, and there was a total of exactly two mushroom slices (canned, not fresh) in the entire container. The ""sautéed"" onions in both were nearly raw and still crunchy. Also, we got double the amount of a different side that we asked for-not a bad thing for us but definitely indicative of the staff's carelessness.  Obviously nothing could be done about any of this because it was take out and it just wasn't worth it to try. To top it all off, we were asked to pay a certain way because ""it would be easier for them since they were just so busy."" Even though I didn't mind, this was very unprofessional and should really never happen. In other visits (dine in), management was very rude toward staff in front of patrons and didn't seem terribly concerned about the quality of anyone's dining experience. I won't stop going to Applebee's because I like a lot of their food and desserts, but I definitely won't bother with this one again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Nikki M.,"Rockaway, NJ",0,59,,4.0,12/1/2015,"I have mixed reviews about all Applebee's. i have never seen the Newton one get so crowded where there was a wait. I have had to ask for my food to be brought back a few times. On one occasion my burger was cold and severely undercooked. I think all chain restaurants are touch and go at times. It is kinda in the middle of nowhere, but then again it is Sussex County.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5

Charles Y.,"New York, NY",0,6,2,1.0,7/30/2015,"Fahgetaboutit. Haven't been to Appleebees since IHOP bought them out. Shouldn't have gone this time either. They used to be good don't like to generalize from one experience and never did like franchise Applebee's but they seem more like IHOP. Unfortunately Needed a place to take grandkids 8 & 5 after day in Land of Make Believe. Appetizers acceptable - kids served and finished eating but our food never came. People seated after us were served. Server kept coming over and apologizing finally called hostess her initial response was ""great"" I kid you not she tried to recover but it was too late. Normally I ask for manager who was nowhere in evidence but after that response I just asked for check. When server brought it she admitted food still not ready. Don't think it was servers fault bad management or somebody in kitchen doesn't like this server either way it will be a long time before I go to another Applebee's probably never",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Faith B.,"Bronx, NY",200,29,56,1.0,7/27/2013,The service at this Applebee's is HORRIBLE. I didn't even want to tip. They are extremely slow even though there were very few people in the restaurant and a lot of the workers were just standing around talking. I asked for a well done burger but got a medium rare one and then the waiter Tyler seemed to have a attitude when I asked for the correct one. I will not be returning to this Applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Santa C.,"Sussex, NJ",0,19,,3.0,1/2/2011,"My family and I go here once a month or so just to get out. even when it is busy we get a table within 15 minutes. Service is normally fast but over the holiday (December 29, 2010) food to the table was very very very slow (about  one hour from taking our order to getting the food).  Our server, Lou. R, was terrific.  The frumpy manager made the rounds only talking to tables who already had their food. Frumpy came by our table and gave the obligatory ""how is your meal"". I said fine but it took over an hour to get the food. Frumpy, very snottily, said they were busy because of the holiday. As I said, I have been to this place every month since they opened and they were no busier this night than any other night.  Walking out I saw three empty tables and  waiting area full of people. Simply put, not enough wait staff and a poor manager made the situation worse than it needed to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
Michael H.,"Montague Township, NJ",0,26,,2.0,1/19/2015,"I have eaten here 6 or 7 times. The food is consistent with others in the chain. However the service is fair-poor. I tend to order the same thing every time; Steak fajita's with well done onions and extra cheese, hold the peppers. I have yet to get the order correctly served. I have had: Onions barely done, No Cheese, No extra Cheese, No onions, Extra Peppers, and once I got chicken instead of steak. That time the server said "" Oh Sorry, I usually order that so I must have screwed up. They're good though, try them.""  Needless to say I wasn't happy. I spoke to the manager who did say something to the server and they did offer to bring me a plate of steak fajitas. However, I was pressed for time so I couldn't wait so I ate some of the chicken. It was dried out.  If they could just get the order right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-newton-5
B X.,"Fredon, NJ",54,28,2,1.0,3/23/2012,"Faty filled sodium vomit. Its Applebees, seriously.....check out their nutritional information. 69 grams of fat in the boneless buffalo wings. And everyone wonders why they cant lose weight? My review will have zero effect on anyone, so enjoy shoveling this garbage into your mouths.
