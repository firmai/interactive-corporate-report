13,David B.,"Finksburg, MD",0,8,,2.0,2014-03-10,"Been eating here on ocassion for several years.  Have noticed portion sizes really getting smaller.  Just had two differentvchicken penne dinners and only about 1/4 of achicken breast cut up on eat one.  For $15 a plate, that's just not acceptable.  Flavors were good, but really felt ripped off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
9,Dawn H.,"Reisterstown, MD",21,22,14.0,2.0,2015-05-16,"Still no potato twisters and the tortillas with queso taken off, too???? Maybe Applebees should mass market their queso.. Not much else on the new menu impresses me, especially the new different sizes of stuff.. Have noticed not as busy anymore, either.. Why do businesses change things that are working? Well, at least there's no wait for a table any longer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
12,Jess D.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,16,,1.0,2015-07-26,"Junk...inedible junk!! For some odd reason we let our kids talk us into going to Applebee's once a year and every time I say: ""never again"", this time I mean it! Barf!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
10,K H.,"Hampstead, MD",19,1,,1.0,2015-10-11,"Service was very good, but food was awful and very, very overpriced!  We had fish and chips, potstickers, and chicken won ton tacos--all of which tasted like it came out of a box and was heated up in a microwave.   We aren't picky eaters, but the food was terrible.  Never, ever again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
6,Michelle O.,"Westminster, MD",55,28,69.0,5.0,2015-10-13,"Overall, a solid 4 stars, will even say 4&1/2 of late at this location. The service is always OK or better.  Even their less than perfect servers are improved by the teamwork we see at this site. The tabletop device allows drink refills to be requested even if the server is busy elsewhere. It also can expedite bill payment. We had another tasty late supper tonite, so it's time for me to risk jinxing our Monday nite Burger streak & commit to this review. Have loved their Oriental Chicken Salad for years, & their Grilled style has become my new fave. Their other ""2 for $20"" entrees have been consistently tasty.  We dig the salsa Verde brisket nachos. The mozz- sticks are plenty cheesy, & 8 in an order allows easy sharing, also a kids fave. We have tried the chicken wonton tacos, pot stickers, & all four Boneless Wings, & enjoyed them all. (Sweet Chili is the best wing sauce, nice sweet heat & spicy  build ;-)   The kid's chicken tenders are decent sized white meat strips, not mere re-formed white bits pressed together. The fries have been hot & tasty, sometimes the kids like the seasoned ones, or the fresh chips instead. I also like the Sweet tater fries, but the kids don't eat enough of mine, so I eat more than I should.   The All Day Brunch Burger rocks. Three times now the egg on top has been perfectly cooked, hot but still oozy. I get cheddar instead of american, & hold the ketchup, since the yolk is saucy enough & the brioche bun is fresh & soft. The patty was perfectly cooked, w/ onions & bacon seared inside + hash browns on top, too. The Blazin' Texan Burger is all about the jalapeños, sometimes spicier heat than others,but always tasty. These specialty burgers had the unlimited fry refills, added bonus. We also enjoy the Chocolate Meltdown for dessert, again large enough to share. Chocolate Lava cake+ vanilla ice cream & fudgy chocolate sauce, what's not to love. How many spoons? The restrooms have always been clean & tidy, appreciated by us hand-washers & this ice tea AND water drinker! We avoid the Friday nite Local Band hours, just too loud & offkey for our taste. There are regular groups here most Saturdays, but they seem able to handle groups well, whether reserved or not. This site has done many school fundraisers over the years, & is really a solid addition to the community. We hope this site keeps up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
8,Stephnie T.,"Westminster, MD",0,3,,5.0,2016-01-02,"Just had a really enjoyable night hanging out with a large group of friends at Applebee's -- where the waitress was wonderful, and fully deserved the extra tip that many of us gave her.   How she dealt with all the musical chairs that was going on and remembered each person's order was remarkable.  Kudos to Applebee's for having well-trained staff who are willing to work with large groups of people, and allow us to do individual checks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
4,Julie A.,"Westminster, MD",3,25,179.0,5.0,2016-01-28,"I am a regular here for a reason. It's clean, the food is great, the servers are always friendly & the menu has something for everyone. Best Applebee's I've ever been to & I'll always be back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
7,Angela S.,"Little Rock, AR",17,6,4.0,5.0,2016-08-17,"Friendly staff,  fast service,  clean environment.  Been to other locations,  but this was the best.  Food was perfectly cooked  (and I really don't like sirloin steaks,  usually get ribeyes). Will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
5,Amanda F.,"Hanover, PA",8,16,7.0,2.0,2017-03-27,"So dissapointed in our visit :( I ordered the pick 3 sample platter and in that I decided on steak quesadillas, hot boneless wings and the wonton tacos. To start, my wings came out first...and alone! Not only was the rest of my ""platter"" not ready, these wings were over cooked and did not have the wing sauce I asked for. Instead it seemed as if the cooked dumped hot sauce and cracked some black pepper over them. Needless to say they were disgusting. I did ask our server for more wing sauce, but it didn't help. Next to show up was my steak quesadillas, still didn't have my whole order and they brought me chicken instead of steak. The server quickly took them back and arranged for me to receive a while order of steak quesadillas because of the mistake. Thanks for the effort, but they were horrible. Finally my wonton tacos came and they were the best part of my meal. I should've just order a whole order of them. In all, food was the worst ever and service wasn't too much to chat about. Applebees used to be one of our favorite stops in Westminster but I doubt we will be back. Looks like those chain restaurants care more about mine and expansion over service and taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
3,Patricia R.,"Westminster, MD",10,7,,2.0,2017-06-09,A friend and I had dinner at Applebees on Tuesday night.  We both had the steak salad and shared the onion rings.  I also had the French onion soup.  The onion rings came out almost burnt which we commented on and the waitress brought us out another which was only slightly less overdone.  The salads looked un-appetizing and the French onion soup looked like it had been sitting around for a day or two.  We wondered if it was the regular cooks night off?  We won't be going back.  The margaritas were good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
2,M. L.,"Manchester, MD",0,38,,2.0,2017-08-30,It's Applebee's. What do you expect? Our food was very greasy. The table we had was not clean. The best part about our meals were the fries and the drinks. The music sucked. The only reason I have it two stars was because I had to fill up on fries and drinks and our waitress was very considerate of us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
1,Patty T.,"Barrington, NJ",61,7,,2.0,2017-09-03,"2nd time thought was a charm, nope. Between the rude host to have to clean the booth seat to the ignorant waitress that served us, won't be coming back for a third time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
0,Robert W.,"Littlestown, PA",1,23,39.0,4.0,2017-11-01,"Wife and I ate here for lunch.  We got the 2 for $20 which came with an app and two entrees.  We started with the classic buffalo boneless wings which had a good coating of sauce and good flavor and came with the usual celery and blue cheese or ranch.  Both of our entrees were served hot and in a descent amount of time.  The wait staff were good, but not as attentive with drinks as I would have liked.  Overall good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-westminster-5,,,,,
