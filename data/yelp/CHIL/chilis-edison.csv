Stephen W.,"Edison, NJ",100,107,22,3.0,10/3/2017,"I've been to this Chili's a few times, usually because my mom wants to get the tacos here. I'm on the fence about this place because I'm not sure it really knows what it wants to be and that's a big problem. The atmosphere is kind of reminiscent of a casual family place with food like burgers and tacos and the like. The problem is that there are TV's with sports on. Great so it's a sports bar? Not quite. There aren't enough TV's in the restaurant for everyone to see, so if you want to watch your team you have to sit at the bar. The menu is kind of odd too. They have burgers and fries for people who want that, but they also have tacos and fajitas. So maybe it's about bar food but if you want things like that you can go to Buffalo Wild Wings. The prices aren't that bad and for that reason it's not a bad place to go if you want to have a nice meal with the family. On the other hand, there are better places to go for all aspects of the dining experience. For that reason, I'm really on the fence about what to give this place. I may be back, but it probably won't be my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Tiffany M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",248,121,232,4.0,9/19/2017,"Hey Hey my fun Adventurers!  Dropped by here Monday for a very early lunch---literally the first ones as soon as they opened their doors. Yes my friends and I are weirdos like that.  The bartender was nice enough to seat us, while two other servers doted on us. My friend ordered a chicken dish over a bed of rice and black beans that looked scrumptious. FYI: her plate was clean in the end. I believe I ordered the spicy santa fe salad, with grilled chicken. In was filling and the chicken wasn't dry. The dressing was really tasty along with the avocado. I don't normally order salads but this may be something I'll end up ordering this the next time I go. Overall awesome experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Maria B.,"Colonia, NJ",0,13,,4.0,1/6/2018,"The food is awesome ! The service could be a bit better, our waitress did her job but i tried letting her know it was my friends birthday and she just wasn't that attentive ! Overall good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Bria M.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",54,63,186,5.0,4/21/2017,"When I came here I honestly didn't really expect much. I was hungry and wanted a quick cheap meal. I had to wait for about 10 minutes to be seated which wasn't that bad. If you download their app you can ""skip the line"" apparently. My server Meghan was awesome! She was busy but she was extremely attentive. She constantly checked on us & offered her expert opinion whenever we asked for it. We decided to do the 4 for 35. The Margaritas were DELICIOUS!! I got blackberry margarita. For an appetizer we had fresh guacamole with chips.  For my entree I got the honey chipotle chicken crispers. My boyfriend got the Bacon ranch chicken quesadilla. Everything was excellent! I have 0 complaints what so ever !  Can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Binita S.,"Edison, NJ",118,82,328,5.0,3/27/2017,I use to come here back in high school and stopped coming for years . They have re done their menu over the past few years and have so much more vegetarian options . My go to order here is the Chipotle fresh mex bowl . They always substitute the chicken with a veggie pattie . It is simply delicious . I would eat this everyday if I could . It's a great portion and a great meal .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Jay W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",23,51,4,2.0,2/12/2017,"The prices, as always with Chili's, are a great value. Unfortunately,  that's the only good thing I can say about this particular location. It took a long time (30 minutes or so) to get our order. I had chicken and my wife had steak. They both tasted like they were straight out of the microwave. They were rubbery and flavorless.  Avoid this chili's and go to the Clark location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Stephanie A.,"Edison, NJ",198,73,115,3.0,3/30/2017,"I understand it's a chain restaurant but I find myself here almost weekly. Chilis is so close to me that it's easy to come for a quick beer, quick dinner or even on a Sunday when it's all day happy hour. The food might not always be that great but the people who work here are attentive, friendly and really do provide great service. The menu is usually the same but they change it out every once and a while (The newest edition has the calorie count - ek!!!). Chilis is a causal place to come by for a cold beer and a decent meal but with extraordinary service. I recommend sitting in the bar area as the servers here are more experienced and are also really friendly and fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Patti K.,"Metuchen, NJ",1,8,2,1.0,9/15/2017,"Horrible.   I used to come here a lot to watch baseball, hockey and football.  Loved the staff.   I went tonight and walked right out.   It was filthy.  The floor was sticky and the only four open tables in the bar area were not cleared from the previous customers.   This store lost a customer.  I'll try another Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison

Donald D.,"Summit, NJ",4,34,18,1.0,12/30/2016,"The sad part about this review is that I actually like Chili's! I hope this message can be a wake up call to the management or corporate offices.  First my server was exceptional.  After almost immediately getting the chips and salsa it took at least 35 minutes to get the remainder of the meai.  Ribs were not fall off the bone actually they were pretty dry.  The... burger was cold onion rings cold, On the bone chicken DRY come on this is hard earned money that I spend to frequent your locations. You have to do better!  the server explained there were problems throughout the day and thanked me for being patient As I left on this visit had to go past the kitchen and it was immediately clear that half the problem was many servers/ cooks were congregating & chilling out there on the stainless prep tables. ""If you have time to lean you have time to clean"" there was paper strewn on the kitchen floor.  Does anyone have Safe serve Certification?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Carissa M.,"Elmont, NY",214,27,27,5.0,6/10/2017,"Richa, our server was super attentive! Went here after AutoCon because we were so hungry! Ordered the guacamole and honey chicken waffles for appetizer and mango chile tilapia as my entree. Everything came out faster than I expected and the food was hot! Came in hungry and left very full and satisfied. I ended up spending less than I expected too! This was a pleasant change to how my usual experiences are at other Chili's locations where the food is mediocre paired with slow service. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison
Sage J.,"Woodbridge, NJ",3,34,36,1.0,6/21/2017,"I haven't been to a chili's in years up until a few days ago, my in laws & I had an interesting night.  We got there at 7:20pm, our server was very sweet, places isn't busy, place appears clean, so far so good... We order a few min after we are seated.....fast forward to 8:35 when we ask the server for another water & she appears surprised & says ""Oh! The kitchen lost your ticket, I'll have to take your orders again. I'm so sorry.""  So we re-order, not the servers fault.  Soon after we get our food, a medium rare burger is well done & glasses are dirty  We ask to see a manager, he comes by, has no idea that our ticket was lost, he apologizes offers us desert, we are like sure since we were going to get desert anyway. We explain our server is very nice, but the kitchen lost our ticket etc All is okay, until I guess the manager said something to the server & then a group of servers are behind us, staring us down & talking about us right there.  We left right after. Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison

Thomas B.,"Bethlehem, PA",33,8,12,1.0,5/6/2017,"Go here all the time and this is the third and final time out order will be screwed up.

Swinki B.,"Iselin, NJ",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2017,It was the second time we walked out of this place without eating on saturday. We had a bad experience before but then v decided to give it a second chance and went there for dinner.These people are total racist. They accommodated other parties of white people who walked in after us and we were still waiting to be sat even though they had enough booths left. Very bad and rude staff.

Derek D.,"Colonia, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,4,,5.0,8/6/2017,This is probably the best chilis I have been to. Love the staff and food is alright too.

Nyc G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,7,1.0,9/30/2016,"Service is a joke. Manager Michael is a discrace. I was planning on placing a very large order for the curb side pick up and I have my 1 year old son in the car(it was raining) I asked if someone would be able to bring the food out to the car considering the circumstances (and the fact that it is CURBSIDE) and I was told no by a woman named REY. I then called back and spoke to a Manger(if that's what you want to call him) by the name of MICHAEL who for the life of me can not understand how this man passed the interview to work in the customer service industry. Not only did Michael rudely ask me why I couldnt just get out of the car, he hung up the phone on me when I asked him for the general managers name. Words such as rude and unprofessional are an understatement when describing this man. I was told some rediculas excuse that the servers can not leave the building with their bank on them..when I asked why he as the manager couldn't assist me he refused, raised his voice and spoke over me. This man is a joke and hangs up the phone on me every time I call.I still did not get the name of the general manager of this property and would like someone to call me back immediately.He needs to be reprimanded.  I have already contracted corporate with my request and will follow up daily to make sure these 2 individuals never speak to anyone with that tone ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20
Aman J.,"Philadelphia, PA",88,8,1,1.0,10/11/2016,"This was on Saturday: 10/08/16.  Usually, I like the food at chili's and the food was Ok too but the service was horrible. If it wasn't only option open till midnight I would have left right then & there. The waiter (don't remember the name of the guy) was terrible. Initially, we had ask him 5-6 times for the water to be served, and when the water was served he threw the straw on the table, he just spoof the straws on the table. Later when my friend ordered a drink, he spilled that too on the table. It was like he wasn't even paying attention to anything he did, when we called him and pointed that, he said we spilled the drink while moving it on the table. It was ridiculous. We had to call him 7-8 times for any service to be requested. And finally after all the efforts in calling him again & again, he somehow took our food ordered. He messed up that too. At first he said the 3 for $10 can be altered with veggie burger instead of Chicken/Pork Fajita, so we ordered to 3 for $10 with one regular one (with fajita) and the other one with alter one (with veggie burger). In the bill he added a veggie burger separately, and two (2) 3 for $10 in the bill. Also, the 3 for $10 included 2 desserts (one for each order), he didn't served us the dessert. He said the kitchen is closed and he made changes in bill by reducing $2 off ($1 for dessert).  After all this he expects us to tip him? I had to say, TERRIBLE. This Chili's is the worse. Additionally, they still need to do something about clearing away dirty dishes from vacant tables.   .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20
Timothy W.,"Edison, NJ",0,11,2,4.0,3/28/2017,"REALLY GOOD FOOD AND SERVICE (most of the time). . Apps: Everyone loves the chips and salsa. chips r hot and fresh and salsa is ground up to tomato sauce consistency but has a little kick and alot of flavor. great for my kids who dont dig the chunky ones at other places.Skillet Queso is usually really good but sometimes texture inconsistent. Wings are juicy and tasty. Boneless were also very good. Texas Cheese fries r good too Soups I had were the Chicken Enchilada which is awesome ( i get with lunch all u can eat inc salad). Baked Potato is good and cheesy with heavy of bacon flavor.            Meals: Steaks have always been good. Ribs are tasty but not very filling. slight on the meat but flavor is really good. have had DR Pepper,dry rub, and reg BBQ and all were good. Beef Enchiladas had good flavor for ground beef and was hot and cheesy good. Smoke house combo was ok with ribs (see above) BBQ was a little dry and smoked sausage was average.  also a bit dry I thought and something about flavor didnt like. Pickles were tasty. Craft Ultimate Bacon Burger was cooked perfect not too done and cheese/bacon were good too bacon done good not too chewy and not too well done. Dessert: what can u say all good here! had skillet cookie, molten cake and salted caramel cake fresh tasting and sweet. get the dinner for two and usually plenty, u get choice of certain apps and pick of most entrees (some upcharge). when there for lunch (i sit in bar area for quicker service) Kenny the bartender is great, remembers my lunch order and hostess Maria helps out when things get busy (in bar area anyway)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20

Umar T.,"New York, NY",191,111,322,2.0,8/4/2016,"In terms of service, we had a great experience with our waitress. She made sure our bottomless chips & salsa were truly bottomless and constantly refilled. Our order was taken quickly and came in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were pretty lame and generally flavorless. Portion size was solid and the shrimp fajitas that someone I was with ordered were decent. In general it is a giant restaurant chain so can't expect much from it. My one huge gripe with this place were those tablets they had in the middle of the table. I get the idea - expedite ordering, payment, etc. But really they're just clunky, take up space, and Chili's has the nerve to add a ""Table Entertainment Fee."" Apparently this fee is for playing with the games but the only thing we used that tablet for was to order Dessert at the end of our meal. The tablet should prompt the user about the fee before processing the transaction. Very sneaky. I called the next day and an employee submitted a charge reversal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20

We both ordered with no tomatoes and when both orders came out 30 minutes later with tomatoes she told us both we didn't tell her no tomatoes. No manager even came over.

Cassandra G.,"Avenel, NJ",8,49,30,5.0,10/22/2014,"Not sure why this Chilis has a bad rep. I like this chilis. I always get coupons sent to my email. I'm always down for a good deal. Although their fajitas aren't my favorite, I still love some of the other items on the menu. The mexican egg rolls are delicious! The burgers are good. And I actually really like their bar! They have some really good drinks. The tropical sunrise is so good. I like the long Island iced teas and the margaritas come in HUGE glasses unlike other restaurants who charge you the same amount and give you much less of a drink. The chips and salsa is really yummy too. The chips are nice and flakey, salty and light. I love their desserts too. Just recently I received an email that they have some new additions to their menu. I'm excited to try them. I also like the kiosk at each table. It keeps the kids entertained and you can order refills on drinks, order new drinks, play games, order dessert and even pay your bill and have them email or print your receipt right from the machine.

My Margarita was straight up lime juice, my food did not taste good, even my water tasted weird.  I don't know what other reviewers were talking about when they said the fajitas were great, they were probably the worst fajitas I've ever had.  They tasted like the chicken came out of a microwave bag, it was accompanied by a poor selection of somewhat old looking guacamole, low-quality three cheese mix, and shredded lettuce. The chips and salsa were the only redeeming quality of my restaurant experience here. They were actually very thin, salty and crispy and the salsa had a good flavor.

Amanda Y.,"New York, NY",374,63,5,2.0,2/28/2011,"This is a neighborhood spot for me and I've been going for years.. but not because it's anything special, but because it's close-by and convenient. I usually get my meals from here to go now since I've grown accustomed to multi-tasking while eating.  Plus, I like packing my own left overs. It's standard chain eating.  Nothing fancy.  The service isn't terrible, but it's not stellar either.  If you're there with a big group, you can get away with being pretty loud.  It always reminds me of taking over spots like this in high school and college.  Nobody should give you any problems if you're low maintenance. ** If you check in to Chili's using 4square, you can get a FREE order of chips & salsa.  I've done this several times over the past year or so.  However, every time I show them the coupon code, the servers seem to be lost and not know what to do.  A manager is always called.  If they say it's invalid, ask for the manager (often they are looking for a 10 digit code that doesn't exist).  Get your free appetizer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
Michelle L.,"Iselin, NJ",1,66,33,2.0,10/20/2014,"Sad that they don't have the bloomin onion anymore. That was such a huge hit! I miss the spicy sauce that came with it too! This place is nothing like it use to be! It decor was so cool with old antiques around the restaurant, now its just boring and plain. My mother and I had lunch here a few weeks ago. As we were being seated we noticed that all the tables had a mini ipads on them with advertisements, games, apps etc.. After we ordered we heard two girls at the table behind us say that they didn't play any games on the ipad so why are they being charged $2 dollars on their bill that says ""games"" the waitress apologized and said that she would fix the problem. Now my problem with this is that why are they charging you to play games while you wait for your food? No where does it say that if you open up a game or app that it will charge you. I think that is nonsense.Way to rip of customers $$! And I feel sorry for families that go here and have kids with them because once the kids see a cool ipad with games they won't hesitate to play and since it doesn't say that they will charge you, no one will have a clue until there bill comes. So yeah, We had ordered 2 for $20 meal and you can choose up to 3 items. When we got our food there was hardly any food on our plate...very small portions and very bland food. When we got our bill we noticed that they had charged us $2 dollars for a stupid game that we didn't even play! We didn't even touch the ipad! The waitress apologized to us and took the $ off and said that they have been having problems with this all day...well maybe if it is such a problem get rid of the stupid thing!

Kim R.,"Canton, ME",23,84,,2.0,8/2/2011,It seems like everytime i visit here it seems they keep cutting more and more corners. I used to love their burgers and now their just blah. Their honey mustard for their famous chicken crispers isn't the same either :( desserts still good and drinks but I think chilis is on a downward spiral. Oh well,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
Arthur D.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,15,2,4.0,11/23/2011,"We (party of 4) ate here last night, and had been here before. We had a waiter in training, as well as his trainer, so the service was superior. The food is consistent here in both presentation & quality, which is not always the case in chain-type eateries. I had the dry rub ribs, which is my standard here, and I do recommend them. Other entrees included a burger, fajitas, and chicken strips, which were all good. Shared appetizer was cheese fries - also good! If you're looking for good (standard fare) food at reasonable prices, this is a good bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
Kristine M.,"Fords, NJ",18,38,152,4.0,1/28/2011,"Consistenty great food for the value.  Usually get great service, except for the occasional slow server.  Coupons have always been accepted even from Check-in apps.  The seating by the bar is usually available and the several tvs show a variety of sports channels.  A good go to for a last minute get together w/ friends",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
Kimberly H.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,6,,1.0,5/19/2013,"Um, are you kidding me? I have been to many a Chili's in my time and this is by far the worst. Service deplorable, cleanliness non-existent and food less than mediocre. The manager clearly doesn't care about this restaurant, and it's apparent from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. Just don't waste your time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
Jennifer W.,"Metuchen, NJ",5,16,17,1.0,5/12/2010,"Wow, I hate to say this, because I don't like to give a bad review. It was sooo cold at this location tonight, we were miserable. The salsa was very hot and watered down. We were looking forward to visiting a former favorite burger joint,  but were let down. Hope it turns around, soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
Farah C.,"Iselin, NJ",0,21,,2.0,7/18/2010,"This particular Chili's is a gamble, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's a huge disappointment.  We eat here 2-3 times a month since it's so close to our house.  Dinner service and quality tends to be better than lunch time.  We've actually found it to be best to just call ahead and get the food to-go.  I do really love the new chili chicken soup on the menu, it's delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40
