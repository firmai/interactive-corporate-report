308,Janella B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",70,149,113.0,3.0,2012-01-08,So basically we went here this past Sunday because I had a gift card from work.  First off the waitress was great though I forgot what her name was. I had that cherry lime type drink with a little vodka that was pretty good. He ordered the quesadilla (yum btw) and I ordered a cup of clam chowder and the bbq chicken wrap. The soup was okay until my spoon hit mid cup and I was thinking hey a nice big piece of potato. Wrong it was a huge clump of soup mix and I was grossed out so I gave it to the bf. The bbq chicken wrap was good as always and garlic fries refill almost made up for the piece of soup powder in my food. It was an ok experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=300,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.1160000000000005,3.2000000000000006
306,Martha D.,"Van Nuys, CA",18,36,,5.0,2012-01-20,"We usually don't come to this Red Robin but since its closer to work, my friends decided to stay local instead of taking the long drive to Topanga. My friends find it funny that I eat from the kids menu, but I wasn't that hungry to eat a big burger.  I am still a child at heart, I don't mind eating from the kids menu and what I love most is seeing peoples reaction when I asked for it.   While we waited for the guys to arrive my friends and I entertained ourselves with the kids menu; it has tic tac toe games, you can draw and all these things to keep the child entertained.  The guys came, one of them didn't know what to eat, he asked what was I eating I said I was eating from the kids menu, he thought it was funny but guess who turned out eating from the kids menu?    I got the pepperoni pizza with fries, it might be a small meal but it fills me up and its less than $6 bucks.  If I want more fries I'll just ask my friends to ask for more, that's one of the things that I love from this place the endless fries! The food is pretty good, the burgers are about $10 each.  The host, and both our waitress and waiter were very nice and very attentive filling up our drinks and just making sure everything was ok. Definitely a place to visit if your at the Northridge mall.  It is either this place or Tommy's that catch my attention to eat while at this mall.  The food court does not have appetizing food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=300,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.3480000000000003,3.2400000000000007
282,Crystal L.,"Burbank, CA",24,95,6.0,2.0,2012-03-19,"I am an alumni of CSUN and still live in the area so despite graduating I still go to Red Robin from time to time. This particular review is about today's visit. My roommate and I were hungry and decided to go to Red Robin for lunch. Came in around 2:30-3PM and since we beat the lunch rush, were seated right away. My roommate told me that he goes pretty regularly and apparently the waitress, Kristi must have noticed too. Homeboy got two free refills of his soda -- without even asking! But I guess Kristi thought I was his girlfriend or something because she never gave me a refill until I asked for one. She made verrrrrry frequent stops at our table to ""check"" on us (aka ogle my roommate). It was hilarious at first because I would answer ""yes we are fine"" and her smile would fade because I was answering, not my roommate. But after a while it got a bit cumbersome.  So the tall white waitress with the plastic black frame glasses... I guess she'll treat you like shit if you show up with a guy she thinks is attractive!  The food this time around, much like the inappropriate service, was abysmal. My roommate ended up not finishing his meal because he bit into his chicken tenders and it was mushy. I didn't end up finishing my burger as the ""special sauce"" they put on my bun started to taste funny.  Once we were done with our meal I asked Kristi if I could make an order to-go. Our haplessly-smitten waitress FINALLY got the clue that my roommate and I were definitely not on a date and was super sweet as pie to me, promptly handing me the menu, all smiles and flowers and shit. (no lie). We grabbed the food when it came out (did't take too long and conversations help pass the time) and left. We didn't even leave the parking lot when my roommate turned to me and asked if my stomach was feeling weird. It was. When we got home I gave my boyfriend his food and after he ate his meal, my boyfriend said his stomach hurt too. My roommate ended up puking for a while as we were pretty sure his chicken tenders were undercooked (mentioned earlier: the chicken was mushy). My boyfriend and I also took a few trips to the bathroom. Hmm Red Robin needs to seriously re-train their cooks! 2 stars for the awkward comedy I watched unfold before my eyes between the our lovestruck waitress and my roommate.  I think I'll only go back again to see if she hits on my roommate for shits and giggles. No thank you on the food poisoning, please.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=280,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0160000000000005,3.2400000000000007
192,Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",507,559,1042.0,4.0,2012-04-06,"I orginally love Red Robin but I came especially today because I got a $5 off coupon from facebook (LOL) My sister and I ordered the ""Freckled Lemonade"" (sounds so cute) which was basically a strawberry lemonade. And now usually, american restaurants, appetizers are always too large in portion and pricey so we don't order apps but there was a special box at the bottom of the appetizers menu and it said ""single order"" for like $3 something.. We ordered the single order of cheese sticks and it came out to be about 5 pieces. It was great :) Tasted awesome too! I ordered the BBQ Whiskey Chicken Burger and since my sister is a pescatarian, she doesn't eat meat. She ordered the Garden Burger ( Ewww..). The burgers were good, well I didn't try her Garden Burger but mine was GOOD:) Did I mention how much I love their fries?! Now usually I don't like fries with ""guts"" you know... the mashy-ness (if you don't get it... the texture of the potato inside) But!! Red Robin fries are to die for.. (not literally)! If you haven't yet, you have to mix up ketchup and tabasco and dip it! My favorite way to eat fries :) This review is making me want more of those fries :) OH, our server was friendly and quick but.. he didn't take my empty drink but brough me a new one before I asked. Another girl had to come over and ask me if everything tasted good and she took the empty plates and cup. I don't know if it was normal, but i think like 3 different servers came to check up on us O_O ... After I paid, the server came by and dropped off the receipts and gave both of us a free drink coupon!

336,Simon K.,"Northridge, CA",0,5,,1.0,2012-04-20,"One of the worst experiences my family and I ever had. After we got seated, not one person made an attempt to greet us, take a drink order or acknowledge our existence. We sat there for nearly 15 minutes looking around for someone to come over and even caught the hostess who seated us as she happened to walk by. She mentioned the situation to a few people who whispered around as if it wasn't their station or problem. We finally got up to leave. As I walked out the door, I asked a lady for one of those review cards they have laying around all the tables and I got the smart ass remark of ""here's my card also"" This was the General Mgr, Kathy.

There food used to be pretty good, especially there Boca burgers. However this last time I barely had 3 bites of my burger cause it had been overcooked. The outsides were rubbery and hard. I was so unpleasant. my friend who I came with is vegetarian and a picky eater. She has been running late but knew what she wanted. Sadly it was no longer on the menu and instead of the server who should know the products enough to suggest something only said something about the Boca burger.  Nothing else and just stood there until said that we need another minute.

I saw the whites of my waitress' eyes twice throughout the entire meal and the food was ok. I'm on a strict diet at the moment, so I have to be particular while ordering my food now at any restaurant.

157,Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1055,641,3504.0,3.0,2012-09-24,"I love coming to Red Robin for its sports bar atmosphere and good food. It's also a lot closer to my house then Topanga location. They have lots of flat screen TV's for catching the game and cool picture decors of sports and movie poster all over their wall. The location inside the Northridge Mall is better and convenient alternative to eating at food court.  I usually come here when I go shopping at the mall and don't want to drive around town to look for a place to eat.   When I come here with a family and friends during lunch or dinner time, wait time averages about 10-20 minutes. Service is usually good depending how busy they are. I've had a few bad moments where the food took a long time or they made a mistake with my order, but followed by excellent service the next visit.  The burgers here are insanely delicious and they got a great selection to choose from on their menu. My favorite burgers are the whiskey BBQ and Royal Red Robin. The Whiskey BBQ Burger is infused with their signature bourbon BBQ sauce topped with cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, fresh tomatoes & mayo. The flavors just explode in your mouth and so delicious. While the Royal Red Robin is topped with fried egg, hardwood-smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. The smokiness of the bacon and fried egg make this burger decadent and so good. Add bottomless fries and freckled lemonade which include free refills, I'm in food coma.  Overall - Red Robin is a fun place to kick back and enjoy good food. They also have great selections of salads and entrees for those who aren't in a burger mood. Note: They also have Glutten free bun's for those who are looking to reduce their carb intake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.2120000000000006,3.2800000000000002

It's bottomless fries so I don't order a side of regular fries since it already comes with the burger. I believe garlic fries are free. That's what a friend of mine told me and last time I went we ordered them and I checked the bill and there weren't any charges for garlic fries! Is it just me who didn't know this? I was simply amazed at this new facts. I'm not sure what the deal is but either way we weren't charged for garlic fries. Their onion rings are very good as well and a small is usually a good portion for two people.  Service is friendly and I never had any complaints about the servers there. Came by and checked up on us every now and then and all I ever had to ask for was the check. Parking is the mall parking lot so it can get crowded sometimes. I usually park in the upper lot because it tends to be less crowded up there and I just take the escalator down to the first floor where Red Robin is.

191,Matt A.,"Pasadena, CA",49,218,161.0,2.0,2013-05-07,"I have mixed feelings with Red Robin.  I think they have some decent party hour food and burgers that aren't too bad.  I've had a fair number of the burgers, including the chicken sandwiches and appetizers and you're not getting a top shelf burger but its sort of family meets beer. The main reason I gave the 2 stars instead of a 3 or 4 is that it seems to never fail I get terrible service.  The waiters and waitresses are nice enough but it seems they are spread too thin or there is a lack or organization between the management and their staff.  Training may also been needed on both sides to tighten the ship up. Typically it starts out well, I've always been seated quickly which is great, the menus are fast, the staff usually get the orders together and into the kitchen and the food generally comes out consistent and fairly quickly.  Where things tend to go south are refills on drinks or getting your waiter outside the times they specifically come by to see if you need anything else.  On a couple occasions I've had a obviously dirty cup (with some lettuce inside) and I understand they probably throw it through a machine washer but when it comes out the person stacking them for use missed it, whatever process it goes through to make it to the waiters stack missed it, the waiter missed it and then...it makes it to my table and if you don't catch it right away good luck trying to get your waiter for a replacement.  So this adds to my training comment or, it might be representative of a worse issue where the staff don't care to check the details, I'm hoping its the first one.

Firstly, their ""endless"" fries. They decreased the amount of fries they would have given you on a normal order and then made the rest endless - as if you would ask for another basket of fries. Why not just give me the regular amount of fries you would have given if I were in a normal restaurant. Our second beef was with the bad service. We were seated in the bar area at the high dining tables. Our server was very nice, very friendly and took our order very promptly. The trouble was that she was also the bartender, so she had to make all of the drinks for the entire restaurant and try to be a good server. Poor planning on Red Robins part.

227,Bryan E.,"Northridge, CA",756,125,333.0,2.0,2013-10-29,"This was my first trip to Red Robin and I reckon, it will probably be my last. Firstly, I'm not a huge fan of shopping malls. Albeit, the restaurant is actually located in the Northridge Fashion Center, which I didn't know until my friend told me, as we were approaching the mall. She failed to leave out this important detail, when asking me if I wanted to get a bite to eat. She kinda suckered me into to going, telling me how great a place Red Robin is. She obviously, therefore, has eaten at some real shitholes, if she considers this a great place.  I believe her ulterior motive, was just to go clothes shopping. So she slighty engaged in deception, to get me to take her. I was hungry, so I was looking for some food. Since I hadn't been to Red Robin before, I was definitely willing to try it. Had I known it was at a mall, I reckon I would've gotten the flu.  The first thing I noticed was how crappy and congested it was. That was before we actually ate anything, just as we stepped inside. It gets worse. The only way the tables could be closer together would be to stack them. I hate sitting on stranger's laps when I'm eating. If you have no personality, this is definitely the hangout for you. Make sure you take a really good look at the staff on the way in, because that's the last you'll see of them. We just went and sat at the first table we saw that was available. Since the hostess didn't seem that eager to seat us. Just out of curiosity, are the waiters trained to bang into you, as you walk to the restroom? For a moment, I thought I was looking at a picture on the wall, when suddenly it moved, it was our waitress. On this day, the staff was charmingly incompetent. This place probably has a great reputation for those people who don't get out much. I asked the waitress if I could please get a strawberry lemonade, ""Of course, not a problem?"" Well it obviously was a problem, because she brought me a Diet Coke. I know strawberry lemonade and Diet Coke sound exactly the same, but she did write it down, so I thought.  After a long and ardous job of deciding what to eat, I just settled on a chicken breast sandwich and a caesar salad on the side. I figured this should be a safe bet, assuming they cook the chicken. Poor assumption! Unfortunately, they seemed not to have learned yet, that heat is an integral part of the cooking process. This would actually be a really good place to take co-workers you don't like. The food may be awful, but at least the service was slow, they're certainly consistent at something.  My chicken breast sandwich comes with an entire vegetable garden, which would've been fine, if I was either a rabbit or the vegetables were fresh. At least my buns were soggy from all the water on my plate, from the six pounds of veggies they tossed on top of them. They've obviously mastered the art of making a chicken breast sandwich inedible. It's obvious, the food tastes better on the menu. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the strawberry lemonade, and the beautiful artwork on the walls, everything else sucked. BTW: unless you've been to this mall, or know someone who has (thanks Amber), than you'll hopefully never find this place, tucked away in the corner. Anytime a mall tries to hide a restaurant from the customers, that should be a warning! The fellow Yelpers that rated this place 4 & 5 stars, definitely had to be intoxicated or smoking some good shit. Here's a suggestion: just get your customers plastered or high before allowing them to eat. Then they'll give you 10 stars, hopefully before they pass out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=220,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.8240000000000003,3.8

326,Lauren P.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,2.0,2013-11-17,"First and foremost, the only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of our waiter. Second of all, I have no idea what was going on with the kitchen staff.  I went in with my close friend who had never been to a Red Robin before. Our waiter, Bryan, was amazing, funny, nice and on point with everything. I told him that it was my friend's first time eating there, and that we needed to make it a good and memorable experience. And boy, was it. My friend ordered the smoke and pepper signature burger, medium well, pepper jack cheese and 2 patties. Mind you, it's an extra $4 for the double patty. I ordered the big tavern, well done, no tomatoes. When the food was brought to us, my friend's burger only had 1 patty, cooked well done with the wrong cheese.  When Bryan came back to check up on us, we told him that my friend was missing a patty and that we'd wait for them to correct the order. It'd take about 15 minutes for the patty to cook. While we waited, I bit into my burger and almost threw up. The meat was cooked medium rare. I absolutely hate, hate, hate uncooked meat (with the exception of sushi).  Bryan brought my friend the correct burger and was caught off guard when I told him that mine was wrong too. I really don't like causing problems and I've never had to send food back because it was wrong for whatever reason, but this was ridiculous. I told him that I wasn't going to pay for our food especially since the whole order was done wrong. He said he understood, and went to consult with the general manager. The manager came back, apologized, brought us the correct orders and removed the food from our bill.  Apparently the kitchen staff had been messing up orders all day long. Not good for a Saturday.

My hubby and I walked immediately to bar area to order, there was 1 couple drinking and waiting for their food, 1 older guy who's already finished his free b day burger and keeps ordering fries. As this older guy is asking her if he can get another order of fries, she puta him on hold and ask as were sitting what would we like to order or do we need a menu, I reply no I know what I want. My hubby went to the restroom, I ordered my food, I paid and I was told 15 mins so I went to restroom. All 3 stalls were occupied so I waited. After a good 7-10 mins I return to the bar where my hubby was waiting.  After returning I noticed another guy there looking thru the menu and drinking a beer from the tap. The bar chic ask if he's ready to order, he replied with a hesitant no and she suggested a simple plain burger. He eventually ordered. A few minutes later he gets his food. We sat a bit longer I ordered a cookie magic milkshake which was good (except she spilled some and filled that missing portion with whip cream). After the guy nearly finished half his burger, my hubby asked if our wait is longer due to it carry out. She said no its all the same but she's checking for our food. Eventually it comes and and I check for freshness. I ordered their ""Famous cheeseburger"" no oinons, Swiss cheese.  1st offense, I waited nearly between 30-45 mins to get my order, 2 O. My fries were so cool to the point they choked you when trying to eat them. I said I'm going to need some fresh fries. If my wait was this long one would assume they'll be hot. Bar chic claimed she just watched them put them in the box. 3 Offense; My patty was the only thing hot, the little lettuce that was on the burger was wilted, along with the tomato, so we're the pickles and the cheese nearly choked me due to them adding extra on the burger that I didn't ask for. This was thee worst burger I've ever all for nearly $10.  The last true offense was that I saw 3 burgers come out prior to mines and their lettuce, tomato, pickles all appeared to be fresh and crisp. What was the problem with mine. I wasn't rude, I smiled and politely answered and ordered, paid walked away and returned.

The bleu cheese was not noticeable on the burger and there were only two small mushrooms, the rest being ""caramelized"" onions that didnt spend much time being on the pan, to be sure. The patty itself was alright but was just a slab of meat, no seasoning at all. Not sure what cheese was put on the patty but it was nondescript. Overall a terrible burger and meal in general.

Place is always loud.  The service, well, it usually sucks pretty bad. I'll spare the details. Upon last visit about 4 months ago, I order the fish & chips which is always really good at the Woodland Hills location. Well, this time the fish was under cooked and totally greasy. So bad the grease went into the fries. Made me sick to my stomach after the first bite. I told the waitress to just take it back and I'm not hungry I just want my money back and she said she'd have to get the manager. Well, she didn't get the manager and handed me the bill and I told her again I'm not paying for it and I had you return it. She gave me a funny look and went, ""Oh, that's right. Ill get the manager."" ERGH! I should have just walked out then. 10mins later, no manager or waitress to be found. So, then the bite of under cooked fish hits my stomach and I had to practically run to the bathroom. I figure after that I will go back to the table and sit down for 2 mins to finish the coke I ordered, and if no manager by then I will just leave. Anyways, on the way out of the bathroom I see the manager helping the servers at the cook station and I pull him aside and tell him the scoop. He apologizes, was very friendly but said he understands and he is totally understaffed and the cooks are not up to par today and he's had lots of complaints. He asks me who the waitress is and I tell him she never told me her name and I don't see her and I haven't seen her but 3 times the entire time. I told him I'm just leaving man and he said ok and sorry again. The waitress seemed like she was totally angry and not in a good mood to say the least. Wan't a pleasant time upon my last visit there and I told myself I won't go back ever to the Northridge mall Red Robin location ever again.  In Wooldand Hills Topanga Mall the service is hit an miss also but the food is usually consistent at least.  I dunno, whenever I've been to any Red Robins, the servers seem like they want to get you in and out of there like a fast food joint.

Instead of cleaning it up right away the hostess prompted us to sit down into the puddled up booth of whatever they decided to ""clean"" the seats with. DISGUSTING.  We decided to continue on anyway as our waitress Brianna was super nice. On my way to the restroom I saw about six open tables in which four of them had dirty dishes on.

The new place is a lot bigger compared to the one in the mall. Interior is avant garde and perfect marriage of colors and designs. A lot less confining. On this visit I ordered the Uberburger, really tasty  and juicy. I have to say RR does make really good burgers. Now, I usually order my burger with the bottomless root beer float and have them bring me a plate of crispy beefsteak  fries for starters. You may wonder why only 3 stars?  Here goes, Rosie introduced herself as our waitress. So we went ahead and ordered. After 15 minutes another girl comes along and gave me a plate of stale fries, which I had to return. Then after another 10 mins, a guy brings me a glass with ice cream, it took him another 5 min to bring a glass of flat root beer. Now the ice cream is melted and root beer at room temp. That does not make it a refreshing float. I didn't return it anymore because of my rapid hypoglycemia.  It took then another 20 mins, finally Rosie appears to bring my burger.  Lastly, I had to ask for utensils and napkins. Wasn't that supposed to come first? At least with the burger I have no complaints. Once we're done eating a plate of over crispy fries arrives. You kidding me? In the occasion of my birthday I got an ice cream sundae, which didn't bring splashes of sunshine on this day.   I had to ask Rosie if everybody was new at this branch, because I do not see any familiar servers. Rosie said some are but most are old. Beffuddling because, it really felt like they were still on a dry run.  I still have to thank them though for my free birthday burger.

There are a little too many things on it that we didn't even use and put everything to the side so that we could see each other.  Anyway after that only con, everything else was positive. The servers were very attentive and kind and happy. We ordered appetizers: Red's Bold Boneless Wings with Buffalo sauce (not spicy for me which I like!) and the Creamy Artichoke and Spinach Dip. Both appetizers were delicious, only thing I can mention to make it better - give us more dip =) it was too yummy.  I ordered the chocolate oreo milkshake and my friend ordered a cider beer (which i forget the name of). My milkshake was very yummy and my friend enjoyed her beverage as well. Now our entrees. I ordered the Clucks and fries and my friend ordered the Guacamole Bacon burger. We both enjoyed our meals very much (I'm a big fan of strips and if those are good the place is good).  This has been the second time I have been to Red Robin, first at the old location inside the mall and the first time at this new location still located at the mall but outside next to Woodranch.  The place was neat and clean, the staff is friendly, the wait was short, the place is louder than it used to be but it's not so loud that it's annoying, my friend and I could still hold up a conversation. I will come here again to show my boyfriend how much I liked it.

205,Nonna O.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,1,,1.0,2015-11-22,I was there today with my hungry husband. We ordered the burgers and both of them were terrible because they were dry and tasteless even though it was their 'gourmet' meat. Meat was very greasy. The aftertaste was like swallowing a hair ball and then trying to throw it back up. We both ate less than half of our burgers. And the fruit salad was obviously not fresh at all. The fruit salad looked like a heavy set sweaty brick layer grabbed a bunch of fruit from a jar that has been on the shelf since Wednesday 2008 and slapped it on to the dish. The service was really good. Our hostess and waitress were very active and pleasant.

39,Judy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,50,99.0,2.0,2015-12-05,"The problem with Red Robin is that they say they have gourmet burgers, but they don't. They have some specialty toppings and a bit of a creative menu, but they're not gourmet. The burgers are average. Run of the mill. They've got to step it up on the burger patty to even approach gourmet.  We ordered a Keep it Simple Burger with grilled onions, a Black and Bleu Burger, and kids chicken tenders. We also ordered the garlic aioli for dipping the fries. If you've got to eat, the burgers are fine, but no better than average. The garlic aioli was no good.  The service was friendly. Both the hostess and waitress were genuine. We did not wait too long for our food.  I don't like the decor much. I like the kitsch in the old restaurant, the miniature Statue of Liberty, a ton of fun posters on the walls, merry-go-round horse, etc. These items often even became part of our dinner conversation. Now it's boring, nothing much to look at. The lights are wrapped in paper. The tables are too close together. We could use some good restaurants here in Northridge.

It is a shame in Los Angeles that any restaurant does not tap into local craft brewers and I rate it as a miss for Red Robin. They could do much better in this area, which is why it is a 4 star rating. The burgers are above average and with multiple offerings to please any palate. I like the fact they roll promotions frequently that allows new tastes to come in and out. The kids menu has many choices as well to please the pickiness kids can have, but what about my craft beer for the beer snob pickiness. Ok, ok it's not about the beer :) wait yes it is, Red Robin get better craft beers! I am always satisfied with the food and if not feeling a burger I go for the wedge and a bowl of chili.

284,Food M.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",0,9,,1.0,2016-03-24,"I was looking forward to giving this RR a shot.  I brought my son and niece for dinner the other night.  We sat down at a somewhat ""dirty"" table.  Kinda sticky.  We ordered.  The waitress was really nice.  Drinks came quickly.  Food came without silverware or napkins (they weren't on the table when we sat down).  Made our silveware/napkin request.  The kids started eating, but I waited for my silverware to cut my burger.  I waited and waited (10MIN+).  Napkins finally came.  Then, we were told the silverware was being washed, so we'd have to wait for it.   I decided to bite into my (Garden) burger as to not wait anymore.  At this point it was kinda cold~not sure if it was the temperature or not, but the burger was just not so good.  Nobody around to send it back to be heated.  The silverware never came.  I ate about 4 bites of burger and left the rest.  When the waitress finally came she asked if I wanted to take my burger to go.  I explained that I didn't really like it, and then explained that it had gotten cold while I was waiting for a knife (which I still hadn't received).  She just said, ""I'm sorry.""  I paid the bill via the table-top computer pay/game station.  I tipped 15%.  My son and niece encouraged me to speak up and say something to management...gotta love those teens.  On the way out I spoke to a manager who offered me a RR gift card to make up for my bad experience.  I explained I would not be coming back.  I showed her a picture of my uneaten $9+ burger.  She again offered the giftcard.  I asked for a refund of my burger since it was uneaten.  She had to ""go in the back"" to ask someone if she could do that.  I waited and waited and waited.  I almost left.  Finally she came back and said she would refund my credit card for the amount of the burger.  It would take 10 days to see the refund.  I agreed.  Personally, I think they should have covered the whole bill.  No silverware???  Are you kidding me???  Never returning.  Want a burger in Northridge at a restaurant?  You're better off at Islands.  You're even more better off at The Habit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=280,2.68,2.74,2.74,2.6600000000000006,2.716

79,Aj A.,"Chatsworth, CA",12,210,2030.0,3.0,2016-04-15,"Finally I got to try out this RR and to be honest, I was not too thrilled about the food. But let me say this, the hostess, ""Jodi"" was amazingly friendly and cheerful. She recommended the Ramen burger which we ended up ordering.  The atmosphere and the ambiance was not bad. If you like to watch TV, they have quite few of them all around the place. Nice small bar where you can have you food and booze while watching some of the sports they are showing.  SERVICE**** I have to say that the service was kind of slow at the beginning. They had this tablet at the table and we were wondering if we were suppose to use it to place our order or not. We decided to try it out, we choose one item but we were unable to order. So the tablet is used as a menu I guess or maybe its activated in different time than the lunch time.  We flagged the waitress ""Jackie or Jacqueline"" am not sure of the name, she was rushing and told us give me a minute please. Few minutes later she came back and apologized, then she took our order. I will say she was attentive to our needs although she was kind of rushing and that is not her fault am sure, I think they were understaffed and that is a management problem that slows down service and full attention to customers. I also notice the bartender who seems to be taking orders from the bar and somewhere else. This guy was a hustler, he was running back and forth none stop trying to take care or bills and other things. Thumbs up to him.  THE FOOD*** We ordered as follow: ===Appetizer===Creamy Artichoke & Spinach Dip and for the price of $7 it was just OK, nothing that wowed us. ===Red Robin's Finest Burger=== Ciabatta bun with double beef, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and egg for around the $15 dollars with all the fries you can eat.  We ordered this to be cooked medium rare and it came cooked almost medium well. It really lacked the taste and flavor, dry, and the fried egg came already with the egg yolk busted and all over the plate. At the end, I told the waitress it was not cooked as requested, she replied "" but you ate it all"" oh yeah we ate it all cause we were hungry and not welling to wait any longer for it to be ordered again. This was not a winner hamburger at all. You can agree or disagree but that is my personal opinion.  ===Ramen Burger===This is what the hostess Jodi recommended. Crispy Ramen noodles shaped as a bun, thick piece of beef patty with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, ordered medium. I have to say this was really delicious. We loved the crunchiness of the Ramen noodles. The beef was cooked as ordered but still lacked the flavor.  I would say that I would not be running to have a hamburger at RR anytime soon.

220,Keren K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,3.0,2.0,2016-04-19,"I'm Re reviewing because I'm so upset from my visit today. My girls realllly wanted to go for their bday dinner. They have a great children's menu so I was hesitant because I know if we come here it's slow rolling.. We arrived and it was freezing from the AC Hostess gave the kids kid menus and when we asked for crayons she said they were out since last nighy . (OK wow that's 24 hours. For a family place that's a long time to be out...) she did bring us markers which was nice of her The server himself was.sweet but the food service   slow. One of my kids menu arrived after the adult entree and we waited more than 15 minutes for it.  Everytime we asked for a refill on food it took so ooo long. Again im sticking to my last review about managemetn... without a doubt the manager Joe (female) is such a bad attempt for a manager. We complained about the pasta not coming for the child.. her response was, ""well it's not ready in the kitchen and the marinara is not ready"".. (after more than 15 minutes) a kids meal? Really how about a manager say ""so sorry let mw go and see if I can get it out."" She never came back to check on anything or if we got the pasta... The worst part which I seriously thought was a joke was I ordered a desert when we were done with the food. (Which half the plates were not bussed and we were left with kids at the table with empty plates all over).. it took more than 16 minutes.. checked on my phone for it. My kids and husband left and went for a walk in the mall and my friend with her child left to go home because she couldn't wait any longer and it was getting late...so I keep waiting and waiting and I ask the server to check..  I sit and wait more with my other child who stayed with me and just us two r left...  Then a few minutes later he comes back and says ""u still don't have it?"" I said no .. (and nd I promised my daughter who stayed with me so I waited more) I said ""no but can u check?"" A few minutes later he comes back with the check and I look at him and I look at the check and again at him and ask ""what about the brownie?"" ""Oh u want it?"" He asks.. ummm yes I've been waiting like 20 minutes and everyone has left what do u think I'm waiting for.. ""oh because I thought u said u don't want it... "" then he says ""they made it I just didn't bring it"".. I said to him to please bring it we have Been waiting a long time. He says ok and then mentions that he took it off the check because he thought I didn't want it.. but because he already took it off he won't add it back on... (oh you think...gee should I thank him?) My whole family left already and me and my daughter were the only one to enjoy it. No one had the energy to wait for this damm brownie. It was good but omg.. this is it... Kids want or not.. never coming back here. Same problems every single timw. And when u sit with kids the last thing u want is to wast time on waiting more than u should. . Seems like this place doe st have correct leadership or managemnt. Servers can't handle the load of tables or customer requests and we all end up leaving disappointed and upset.

This is because for a brief time this was Elephant Bar. They filed Bankruptcy and apparently left  all the tables and fixtures behind when they closed this location. Red Robin changed little or nothing when they moved in. Personally I like this easy to access location at the mall's north end. The hostess directed me to the bar area for immediate seating as the dining room had several people waiting to be seated. I found a high-top table and took a seat. I looked at the menu and decided on the Smoke and Pepper burger with garlic herb fries.  The garlic herb fries were tasty but had more melted parmesan than garlic or herbs. The burger was excellent. The pepper was subtle enough so it didn't overpower the other flavors of the burger. The large patty was seasoned and cooked perfectly.

It also came with grilled onions instead of crispy onions. The watier brought back my burger with a microwaved slice of tasteless cheese melted on top. The burger was overcooked. Most likley due to being microwaved to quickly melt the cheese on it. There were other issues with my burger as well. I took a few bites and got a to go box because it was going to be free anyway, or so I thought, because I had a birthday burger coupon.  Then i find out that because there is a 20 percent off coupon on my card i can not use my coupon for the free burger, i have to use the other one. I ask to speak with the manager who just kept repeating that there was nothing she could do  regardless of the issues with my food.

Seriously, I counted six wait staff, all walked by without noticing at the fact we had a pile of close menus on our table, a computer with a blinking low battery light and all of us trying to make eye contact with ANYONE. The hostess saw me, three times, but still no one stopped by. The busboy cleaned the table right next to us, and never even looked at us. Maybe if the manager, who was flitting around not more than two tables away, had bothered to look around at how his patrons were doing, maybe we would have been noticed.

It must have sat under a food lamp because it was dried out and cold!  The burgers were NASTY!   My son ordered a sunny side up egg to add on to his burger and it was ice cold!  If it weren't for Kathy, this would've been the WORST EXPERIENCE at a restaurant ever!!!  Our waiter was beyond terrible!!! We ordered nachos and 3 burgers but everything that came out (over 45 minutes later, was cold, dry and disgusting!) After we were seated we told him we were so hungry that we didnt care what order the food came out in. He said he would bring some fries out first so we could.start on that. We said ""thank you so much!"" Then when he brought it out, I even did a little dance saying ""YAY! Thank u soooooo much!"" Well I guess he thought that meant he didn't have to tend to us anymore, and that we were happy.  Because after that we literally did not see him for another 45 minutes or more!!!! It was around 9 pm by then and we entered the restaurant before 8pm!  Another server came by and helped us because she saw that we were waiting so long and not being taken care of!  We were grateful to her so we tipped her instead!  We also let Kathy know everything that happened and she did handle the whole situation professionally apologizing to us and letting us know that it was unacceptable and that she would have a talk with him.  I was in shock with all of the comments he made! I can't believe I didn't go off on him of how rude he was and how wrong he was for treating us in a threatening manner! He even said ""when I brought your fries out first, I went from being the best server in the world to the worst server in the world in 2 seconds."" What?!!  We were confused at that comment until we realized that he said that because of my positive ways in the beginning saying ""yay, thank you so much"" and 'dancing'.... This just proved that he felt that we didn't need anymore attention and that he could focus on his other customers! He felt that in his eyes we were good. Off of just 1 basket of fries???  He didn't even give us silverware ir napkins when the  fries came out, and said they weren't clean! So we didnt get our silverware until we asked the other server. My son needed water and asked, he said ok, then we didn't see him for over 45 minutes!  Then when he passed by and said some other comments that just were unacceptable that is when we finally decided to call the manager Kathy. Thank you again, Kathy for taking care of us! The 2nd burger YOU brought out was good, and like we told you, we hope that people at corporate realize what a gem they have in YOU! You handled this whole HORRIFIC situation (where my son didn't even eat until way past 9 and mind you, separate from when we ate) better with your kind and professional manner. We thank you again!

When we told him he left to fix it. 20 minutes later he brings us out the shake, which at this point we didn't even want anymore.

67,Jen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,71,42.0,5.0,2017-04-17,"I don't typically review chain restaurants because one rarely ever differs from the rest, but I felt inclined to review this Red Robin location because I was dismayed to find reviews on here that don't reflect the caliber and quality of the staff at this location.  I work in Northridge and favor this restaurant over the others in the area. For one, I really like that they section areas off by population. The bar and surrounding areas are only for adults 21+, whereas the seating area to the left of the hostess stand and patio nearest the parking lot are for families. That's awesome, in my opinion because no one really wants to be around children unless you really have to be. Amirite?? I digress. Secondly, the staff here is super friendly and consistent. If you feel like chatting it up, the bartenders are happy to oblige, but if you're there to simply wash away the day's nasty aftertaste they are fine with simply refilling your glass and fry basket. Speaking of the staff-Jacklynn, Conny and Alex are some of the best people to be served by. They give you legit recommendations for food and any new beers on tap.  Lastly, although I rarely come here with more than one person, they are happy to accommodate larger parties with a little notice. Even though they don't take reservations, we called ahead for a party of 20 once and by the time we got to the restaurant they were ready for us and we had no wait.  Overall, don't be deterred by the sour Sallies who complain about trying to use expired 15% off coupons on here.

I ordered a guacamole bacon burger. The burger was cooked well, but overall was lacking flavor in the meat and the ingredients were lacking quality. There was barely any guacamole on it so it tasted somewhat dry. The guacamole burger I had at jack in the box was honestly better.  All their burgers come with bottomless fries which is cool, except the taste is a huge miss for me. They taste like pre-frozen, packaged fries and get cold really fast.

Waitress acknowledged but another waitress brought it without soup and said she didn't know. Only a few people eating at 10:15 when we were seated but order took 45 minutes for a soup as entree and simple burger.  Burger finally arrived but missing side salad.  When waitress advised she ran and got the salad but never asked what dressing. Hmm salad and dressing. Hard concept.  Burger came with lettuce tomato and onion on side. Lettuce was totally wilted which you could tell by looking or touching.  Told waitress when she came after asking for her since she never came to check in on us for refills.  We left without tipping vowing never to return. As we left young guy tells us "" hey guys have a good night"". We are not guys.  Nor dressed to confuse him of such but senior women who know what is a proper greeting.  Horrible experience to end our Saturday night.  Thanks but no thanks Red Robin.  Both my daughter and my friends daughter are into social media so I am sure this will cover a few hundred people in postings shared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge?start=120,3.04,2.95,2.932,2.7560000000000002,2.9860000000000007

44,Kimberly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",583,103,162.0,3.0,2018-01-09,Hungry for a quick bite while shopping but not a fan of the food court at Northridge mall. Waited here for 10 min. Pretty busy & noisy. Our order came out quick. If you order a burger you get unlimited steak fries. I ordered the chicken tender salad but no bacon or cheese & my order out with bacon. Waitress was quick to have the order fixed & brought out more fries. Paid our check & tip through the iPad on the table. You can pay extra to play games.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge,2.96,3.05,2.912,,3.014
41,Nat M.,"Sylmar, CA",2,74,5.0,2.0,2018-01-14,"Staff is so EFFING weird and beyond rude at this location. I am not sure what it is, but they can be a bunch of a** holes (Not all of them, but quite a few).  It's so unnecessary, don't think I have experienced such rude staff at any restaurant.  Well there goes my lesson, not returning to red robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-northridge,3.0,3.06,2.9,,3.0360000000000005
