189,Mike C.,"Hilliard, OH",54,250,45.0,4.0,2012-01-09,"I really really like BJ's Brewhouse. I would come here more often, however it gets a bit pricey especially coming as a family. They have an absolutely enormous menu, it always takes me several minutes to figure out what I am in the mood for. Everything I have had here has been good, especially the burgers. The beers are pretty good as well. They have a couple solid year round offerings such as the Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout (served on nitro, yum!). The seasonal beers really shine though. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Grand Cru as well as the IPA. They offer most of their beers to go in ""growlers"" which are half gallon jugs. The service is always fast and friendly and the building is a nice, open atmosphere. I like the upscale warehouse theme, which seems like it would clash but doesn't. It is a little tricky to get here due to the mall traffic, and you have to immediately change lanes and turn in order to get there from 270. Overall, for a chain restaurant, I highly recommend BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=160,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006
185,Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3081,6377,5203.0,4.0,2012-01-27,"We went right when they opened and for a chain it is really very nice here! The service is good and the food above your average standard chain restaurant fare! Exstensive menu that made it so hard for to chose, I would recommend going with a bunch of friends so you can sample as much as possible. Not being as fortunate, I did the usual and talked my husband and son into ordering as much as possible and the vegatarian options were left up to me. We started with the best beginnings combo featurung Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls The men enjoyed the cheese sticks while the rest was all upto me and I did not mind one bit, all was delicious and really a huge platter, this is one combo really worth the money! I also had the potstickers which were great as well. My husband had the gourmet mac n cheese which was very very good, rich and gooey just like it is supposed to be! With that he had the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger, it was really like they stated a true knife and fork sandwhich, while it was good, it was a bit messy and soggy for him. I had the whole wheat pizza with Flame grilled Portobello mushrooms, balsamic vinaigrette marinated oven roasted mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh thyme, parsley, Fontina cheese and a drizzle of balsamic glaze which makes me want it all over again just reading this, it was so damn good and right up my alley! Along with that I had the seared Ahi salad with their amazing sesame dressing.  Needless to say we were pretty stuffed the rest of the evening but it was well worth it! One of the top dining choices at Tuttle, great for the family, there really is something for every tastebud!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=160,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
94,Jeremy H.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",99,322,174.0,1.0,2012-03-03,"Let's just start this off by pointing out the obvious.  This place wants to be a cheaper Cheesecake Factory.  Fact:  The food and service is nothing like the Cheesecake Factory.   My wife likes to eat here as they offer some Gluten Free options including a gluten free pizza.  Gluten free restaurants are few and far between so those few that offer a menu for the Celiac crowd get business even if the food and service is awful. My biggest beef with this place...parties of 5.  That's right, does your party include 5 people?  If so you are fucked!  They have 2-3 tables specifically for parties of 5.  So if you get there and tell the hostest you have a party of 5, you will see parties of 4, 6, and 8 come in, give there name to the hostest 20 minutes after you, and get seated 20 minutes before you.  Absolutelyfreakingridiculous!  I complained to the manger immediately as I'm not your typical hipster girl yelper who sees Yelp as a place to get revenge after the fact.  If I have a problem with a place, I let them know, to their faces, immediately.  Just think of how the quality of Yelp reviews would increase if you had to speak with the manager about your experience before reviewing?  Anyways, the manager said he'd see what he could do...which was nothing.  No putting a chair on a table for 4, no giving us a table for 6.  We will never go here again because of this. Also the food just isn't good, nor is the micro-brew beer and I've tried most of them.  Pretty poor excuse for beer.  I know for a fact the last three times we have came here, our food wasn't prepared right, or it just didn't taste well.  You're far better off going to the Cheesecake Factory, it will cost you a few more bucks, but it's going to be on another level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=180,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003,2.8200000000000003
195,Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",183,1934,1243.0,3.0,2012-03-20,"I was prepared to be disappointed, knowing it was a chain and reading a few of the other reviews.  And: I wasn't.  Low expectations?  Maybe.  But it was a good experience. The service was very good.  The place is pretty nice.  I tried the root beer first, and it wasn't bad.  Not great, but pretty good: a mellow blend of herbal and sweet, not too carbonated or overly sweet.  Next I had a flight of beers.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of sampler on the menu, but you can get 4 good-size beakers of whatever you want.  I tried the Hefeweizen, red ale, ""Abbey Normal,"" and porter.  All were good, not great.  I particularly liked the red and the abbey-style.   Lots of good stuff on the menu, but I didn't want to go overboard.  Tried the fried artichokes and the avocado egg rolls.  The artichokes were really good, and came with a ranchy dipping sauce.  The egg rolls were also good, with large fresh chunks of avocado and a blend of other ingredients.   Don't know if I'll be back soon, but that's not because it's bad- just that there are so many better places out there.  Plus, I'll admit, I was a bit disappointed in the root beer.  I had hoped it would be good enough to justify taking some home, and coming back regularly.  Nah.  But it's worth trying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=80,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

It was a strange experience where we were made to feel bad simply because our IDs were from out of state, which was uncalled for since I'm 32, balding, and fairly weathered looking.  Which is too bad, because otherwise I think we would have enjoyed our dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=100,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.048000000000001

We stopped in at after 11 on a Friday night for a drink or two after a movie so we could continue the discussion/argument about said movie.  The place was pretty empty, there were a couple groups in the bar area and some people on the nice looking patio. We sat at the decent sized bar, which got immediate points because they have hooks under the bar were I could hang my purse (why don't more bars do this?). The bartender was quick and good, although she did try and steer us towards the lighter beers. I had their stout which was pretty tasty, smooth with a good coffee flavor. My friend had the blonde which he enjoyed. I tried the Irish red later and it was a nice, well-made beer... would be nice to have on the patio.  Overall, it was nice.

My husband and I decided to try the two for $19.95 deal, which turned out to be a great choice.  We each got a salad, which is then followed by a medium pizza and then the signature BJ's dessert, a pizookie, to share.  I went with a House Salad and my husband with the Caesar.  Both were pretty standard, a nice way to start the meal.  For the pizza, we went with a sausage and mushroom on gluten-free thin crust.  It was delicious as always, and there was no upcharge for the toppings or gluten-free crust.  It was our first time trying the pizookie - it was amazing!!  We had the gluten-free chocolate chip, and it was soooo delicious.  It comes out warm and gooey in its own little skillet, topped with vanilla ice cream.  There are several other varieties, too, for those who can eat gluten.   The restaurant itself was very nice and clean.  There is a cute little patio outside, although it does face into the mall parking lot.  We really enjoyed our visit here and would definitely come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=100,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188

Anyway, wife ordered the Ma-hi Taco and a house salad, I just ordered the Calamari appetizer - not being that hungry. I also ordered a glass of wine and was ready to order another when I decided to check out their beer list.  My appetizer was very good, my wife said the taco was okay.  However I am thinking we were just skimming the surface here and not knowing what to order. Like their pizzas and many other items I can think of.  The ambiance is excellent, the service very good. The mural on the back wall of farm workers and wheat is a nice mural and reminded me of other similar murals I have seen, has a good effect.  Our waitress when asked said to try the Jambalaya, I definitely will on my next trip when I am hungry.  Her service was very good, attentive and fast. Although have to admit the place was not that busy when we were there but it doesn't matter. She was very helpful as well.  Now about that beer list - I am not much of a beer drinker at all. Every now and then, like 2 times a year I drink beer. Well I think that is about to change - I ordered a BJ Blonde OMG what a wonderful tasting ice cold beer. It was truly excellent.

BUYER BEWARE!   Arrive before 12 Noon on a weekday or suffer the consequences of a lengthy wait.  A good sign that the food and service is good.... but I hate waiting. The food is above par at BJ's - and the servers will listen to you if you've got something you'd like to try.  EXAMPLE:  There are three salads on the lunch menu:  garden, cobb, honey crisp.  They're all chicken-based presentations.  Me?  I asked for blackened salmon as a substitute on the cobb salad and it was a good lunch portion and the salmon was cooked to perfection.  My co-lunchers got a personal pizza (cheese) and it was consumed with glee while the other got a gooey-looking chicken sandwich. One thing that was on the ""weak"" side was a side - chips and salsa.  Of course, what can you do to make that app better than most?  Dunno.  But industry standard corn chips (yellow and red) with a small cup of a sauce that was a mix between salsa and marinara sauce was disappointing. BJ's is pushing what a lot of restaurants are pushing these days and that's craft style brew.  A full menu of what's being poured is front and center in the servers' minds and that's cool.  But beers during a business hour lunch?  Uh.... c'mon.  But maybe I'm the prude. I like their interior presentation.  The bar is cool looking.  The patio is smallish and not all that good looking since seated there you'll be looking at Tuttle Mall... but it's summer and you're outdoors.

My only complaint might be in the onions' power - their strength tended to beat the other ingredients into hiding. I paired the pizza with a Jeremiah Red Irish ale, which was well-crafted, but lacked anything to really distinguish itself from any other amber or red ale. It was satisfactory, but wholly forgettable. I finished with a macadamia nut Pizookie - a deep-dish cookie with vanilla I've cream. While delicious, and the perfect finish to my meal, it really should be shared by two or more people. I learned later that the dessert was well over 1,000 calories - more than the rest of my meal combined. Service was excellent, prompt, and professional.

I am able to come here with my picky boyfriend who will only eat pizza and bar style food, find something for him to eat and also find myself a nice gourmet meal.   The Hawaiian Mahi Mahi is absolutely delicious for being on the low calorie menu. It doesn't lack in flavor like most light dishes.  I also have to mention the balsamic glazed chicken.  A-m-a-zing!!! The glaze is spot on and not too strong.  The whole plate has a great balance of flavor and I usually always end up getting it even after spending a long time perusing through the large menu.     The reason for my 4 out of 5 stars is because they frequently mess up the dishes.  I'm assuming it's because they are always busy, which I can understand, but when there is a mistake they need to compensate for it somehow.  One night I went there with my boyfriend, waited a long time for the food, got the food only the realize my chicken was badly burned on the underside, sent it back, waited a long time to get another one, and ended up eating it after my boyfriend was done eating.  After all of that I was only slightly irritated because the food did taste good the 2nd time around but when the waiter never gave us any sort of reimbursement for the looooong time we waited and I became VERY irritated.  I hate it when managers are too stingy to discount/comp a meal when it's warranted.  Do they really not want to lose a few dollars in order to ensure future business with a customer?  Not a smart business practice!  This wasn't the only time either that they messed up the order and didn't compensate for it.   Anyway, aside from occasional mess ups, I will continue to come here because the food is indeed DELISH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=160,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.216,3.6000000000000005

199,Linda E.,"Columbus, OH",21,96,9.0,2.0,2015-12-22,"(the following review is for their whole online ordering experience only, as our restaurant experience was great) Well weird... had a strange experience with BJ's tonight. We didn't eat in, we got take-out, using the online ordering system (which needs some serious work). I'm not going to go into detail about everything we ordered, but a couple of items were missing/forgotten and my flatbread pizza (the California Club) not only had minimal ingredients (where was the avocado???) but I found tiny slivers of plastic in it!?!?!? I was like wtf??? I pulled them out of my pizza to make sure it wasn't just hardened pieces of cheese, but nope... it was very thin strips of white plastic. In my fricken pizza. How that could happen is beyond me, but it was there. That alone has turned me off from ever ordering from them again. I realize accidents happen, but how plastic makes its way into food is baffling and I'm not taking the risk a 2nd time. Sorry. It appears they don't take as much care on their take-out orders as they do on orders placed in-house.  Also, I'd like to add that their online ordering system p'd me off a tad. I wanted, at first, one of the entrees, but didn't want the sides it came with. However, I discovered that with the online ordering, you can't swap sides. If you delete the sides the dish comes with, that's it, you're done, you don't get to pick something different in its place. You can take away, but you can't add. So if you want a different side, you have to order it separately, meaning you have to pay for it separately, so I decided against that entree because I'm not paying $15 for one piece of fish when I have to add - and pay extra for - the sides that I want.  Speaking of sides, there are no pictures and no descriptions of the items. Side dish of avocado.... okay, um, is that a whole avocado? A half of one? Avocado spread or perhaps guacamole? Side of bacon... how many slices? A side meatball... are we talking just ONE meatball here? For $2.95? You guys really need to be a little more specific.  Also, it would be nice to have the date and time you've chosen to pick up your order displayed on the ""review and submit"" screen. I wasn't sure if the system had recorded the pick-up time and I was a little nervous about hitting the submit button. The pick-up time was correct, but I didn't see it until I received the confirmation email. In other words, if you forget what pick-up time you chose or you want to make certain the time is correct before you hit submit, you'll have to start all over again. Or do like I did... hit submit and pray the correct pick-up time was received. Not cool. All information, including the customer's requested time for pick-up, should be on the final screen before you submit the order. We may eat in again, but no more take-out from BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=80,3.36,3.44,3.44,2.6640000000000006,3.4080000000000004

79,Alex K.,"Columbus, OH",82,7,,3.0,2016-03-11,"Atmosphere: this is pretty run of the mill. It's a huge space with a bar on one side. We came on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Think Cheesecake Factory (I'm pretty sure this was founded or is owned by the same people as Cheesecake Factory) overall the lighting is good, it's not too loud and is pretty comfortable. 4/7  Service: My wife and I were late and were seated with our party promptly. The wait staff was polite and attentive. Once again due to the nature of the establishment, they were well trained and almost mechanicals in their operation. Don't expect anything above and beyond it is what it is. If you are looking for knowledgable staff about beer, go to a real brewery.  4/7 Drink: I started out by ordering a Black and Tan. The restaurant uses their own Brewer pale ale on the drink (I suspect it is really a contract brew and not made by BJs). My drink tastes fine, but I was disappointed by the pour. My favorite part of a Black and Tan is the visually striking contrast between the Guinness and the other beer, however my drink was poured too roughly and the two beers were muddled together. Next I ordered their light lager, feeing in the mood for something crisp and refreshing. Being the restaurants proprietary beer, I figured the brew had potential. Honestly, it may have been one of the worst beers I've ever had. I'd rather shotgun a lukewarm can of natty ice that I accidentally left un refrigerated in the sun for a few days (but that's enough nostalgia for now sorry).  I passed the light beer off to one of my dining companions who also declared it an abomination (but managed to consume it in its entirety) I then went for a bottle of the list. They had a pretty good selection of Belgians. For the wine-o's out there, the wine is reasonably priced and they proudly pour 7 oz (be careful ladies)! Also you can get a mini bottle of Chandon for 9$ (we did duh).  3.5/7 Food: this menu is huge and eclectic, lots of pasta dishes, sandwiches, burgers etc. there was not a whole lot for vegetarians here and I found some the selections interesting (half the food would not pair well with beer, the supposed theme of the place). I went with fish and chips which was average. My wife got salmon and quinoa which looked alright. Prices were reasonable. Everyone was happy. Truly nothing special though.  3.5/7 Overall: if I want craft beer, there are at least twenty cooler places in Columbus. If I want pub fare, the food here can easily be topped. What this establishment does achieve is providing a good place for a group of people with a wide range of tastes. I don't think it is going to blow anyone out of the water but pretty much anyone can eat here, feel comfortable and find something they'll like. 4/7",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8?start=60,3.48,3.47,3.47,2.732,3.474

We got our appetizer and drinks just fine, and ordered our food. She got a bacon cheese burger with wedges, her son got corn dogs, my daughter mac n cheese, and i got the bacon guacamole burger. It took a little bit, but it came out hot. I've never had that burger before, and still haven't because there was a foreign object in my burger.  I saw a jalapeño hanging off the side of the bottom bun. Not a huge fan, so I took them off.    Putting my buger back together, a spot of white caught my eye. You know those packets that say do not eat that you find in new bags, shoe boxes, hats, etc? There was one in my food. Alright.. No need to freak. I didn't take a bite yet, and it's my food not my child's, so, ok. I waited tables for 10 years and majored in Hospitality Management at OSU. Weird stuff happens. Flipping out isn't gonna help things go smoother. Waived over our server (after a few tries, being over looked by the manager I'd soon speak to, and passed by another server) and show it to her. She said Eww and picked up the whole tray, taking it back to the kitchen, leaving me the only one at the table with no food, and no offer of something in the mean time.  Eventually, the manager, Michael (according to our server, who I had to ask because he didn't even bother to introduce himself, and didn't have on a nametag (no one does here)) came over. He bends down to the table and begins by saying that the packet doesn't come from food service packaging. Well thanks for pointing that out. Clearly with my industry experience I would have no idea of that. His tone was accusatory, so I asked him a question. I'm sorry, I'm trying to figure out if you're accusing me of putting that in my food. He immediately backpedaled.. Well.. More like side stepped, and tried to cover it up. Oh no, he says. ""I'm not accusing you of anything. It's just that those aren't found in food boxes and wouldn't be in the kitchen. I don't want it to happen to another guest. I can bring you another burger, or the menu and you can pick something else?"" Nope. No thank you. I'm good. He leaves the table. My friend has lost her appetite. We let the kids eat, pay, and go.

Got a drink at the bar while waiting for a table and the bartender saw that our table was ready and walked past our cars waiting to pay three times before she actually ran it.  Got sat on the patio and our server didn't come up to us for about five minutes. Fair, because we already had drinks but we were hungry and wanted an app. Ordered the app and another round of drinks. My fiancé asked what rotating taps they had and the server said ""Haha, I don't know, we have like six rotating taps."" Didn't even list them off. My fiancé then asked which BJs rotating tap was and the server answered, ""I don't know, a ginger something."" Ok? Thanks for the info.  We put in our food order and barely had finished before we were asked if we wanted dessert. We said no. The food was great, it's rarely not. Shortly after that she brought us our check without even asking if we wanted it. My fiancé and I would've had another beer had she asked but it was pretty clear she didn't want us there anymore. We put our card in the check and it was at least another 5 or 7 minutes before she came back to run it. In this time I waited for another side of the sauce for my food that I asked for (got the avocado egg rolls) and never received that. She clearly didn't want us there!

Also, as a whole i enjoy the Polaris location a lot.  However,  I work right down tuttle and frequently order from here. I will continue to do so now and then because its convenient and they offer a reward system which i like. They mess up my online to go order, without fail, every time. I usually order the lunch specials--ones that come with a side salad, etc--every time i have to say ""uhh hey where is___"" to which every time the person goes ""well did you want_____?"" um yes...its a flatbread and salad combo i obv want the salad.The manager isn't very friendly by any means. There is no consistency with quality when it comes to ""to go orders"". Its always just slopped into a to go container and tossed around and then given to me. They always forget chips with the office orders of fish tacos, or give a whole 3 chips. Sometimes the tacos will be full and sometimes there's barely anything in them. When eating in i have gotten fries instead of chips with the fish tacos, but when i placed the online order and just asked for cole slaw instead of chips the manager told me that chips aren't considered a side and charged me 3.50 for a side of coleslaw which i just paid because i didn't want to make a fuss.  I got a burger once and the onion straws were so stringy i couldn't chew them down to swallow--not sure what the deal is there. I lost my appetite and only had fries that day for lunch. Basically i've ordered everything off the menu and im disappointed 98% of the time with the quality of the food AND staff. Yesterday i got the BOGO and finally had my ""im done"" moment. i got the chicken pita tacos and the bottom of the to go box was full of so much grease that the pita was absolutely dripping. i couldn't even pick them up. The second entree i saved for dinner that night--the chicken was under cooked and pink in the middle. The brussel sprouts were to bitter and under cooked i had to spit them out.

Perhaps due to the crowdedness of the place, I felt it was very loud. We had to listen to each other carefully to carry out our conversation over lunch.

10,Peter G.,"Columbus, OH",210,52,89.0,2.0,2017-04-05,"This place is alright if it wasn't for the ridiculous prices for some of the menu items.   We came here twice, once for burgers and another time for pizza night. The first time was decent to good in rating.  We got the mozzarella sticks which were about $9 since they looked delicious in the picture and description.  We thought the price was a bit high but we really love some good mozzarella sticks.  They came out and to our surprise were just lukewarm.  The cheese was not stringy in the middle and they tasted like they've been sitting out.  They had a good coating although the entire experience was ruined by the temperature of the food and the high price tag. The burgers were good, although I got the bacon guacamole burger and I thought I had managed to remove all of the spicy stuff from the burger when ordering.  I would have never known this burger was spicy in the first place as there is no mention of spicy anything in the description.  Anyway, the burger comes and it turns out even though I removed jalapenos and the pepper jack cheese, it was the guacamole that was spicy as well.  I would have not ordered this burger if I knew the main ingredient on there was spicy.   My partner got the hickory brisket and bacon burger which was a whole other story.  That was actually a very tasty burger and the barbecue sauce they used was also very good.   We finished with their famous chocolate chunk ""Pizookie"" which is what saved this place from getting a 1 rating.  It is basically a freshly baked cookie in a ""skillet-like"" tin as a dish.  It was delicious and the chocolate chunks were big and plentiful.   On to our second visit for the pizza night..... Oh....where to start with this one?  Well, we came in and it was decently crowded with people ordering pizzas. First off, the deal is for half off a large pizza....which honestly brings the price down to exactly what it should be priced and what it's worth.  We got a deep dish pie and added a few toppings of pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza came out and was hot although you could see that they were skimpy with the cheese as there was many red spots of sauce all over the pizza where cheese was missing. Here is the main problem with the pizza.....it just had zero flavor and didn't really taste like anything!  The sauce had no flavor, which could have turned this tasteless pie into something decent.  The toppings were scarce and also didn't have any sort of seasoning or flavor.  The worst part is the bill came out to about $20 for just this pizza!!!  And that was half off!!!  I think $20 is actually overpriced for this pizza, I would have been furious if I had ordered this without the special!!!  Overall, I think I give this place another chance just because of their pizookie's.  Also, they have coupons on their app if you have an iPhone although I don't think they work with their weekly specials.  If you're going to come here, please make sure you're doing it on a weekly special night so that you don't end up wasting your money for some mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8,3.68,3.35,3.35,2.7920000000000007,3.482

The sprouts were cold when brought out from the kitchen, and very dry. No one ever asked how the meal was, so Yelp became the only outlet.  The ribs were ok. They were hot (yeah), and tender, but lacked any smoke flavor and were much smaller than baby backs I buy from Costco. Sauce was ok, but nothing special, and they only sauced 4/5 of the rack (I'm assuming the cook's hand was holding the rack while he brushed the sauce on and never bothered to finish the job.)

7,Emma B.,"Columbus, OH",5,24,54.0,2.0,2017-07-29,"So let me just start this by saying that we've been to this BJ's before and had always had a good experience. Today, however, was extremely disappointing.  We were seated quickly on the patio by our request since it was 75 degrees and sunny. We looked through the extensive menu and decided we wanted nachos as an appetizer (nachos aren't an actual menu item but they can make it on request since they have all the ingredients to). They came pretty quickly, though there was a bit of a mix-up when the nacho flatbread came instead of actual nachos. This was understandable because, as I mentioned, nachos aren't an actual menu item.  Anyways, the nachos (when they came) had little taste and were not very appetizing at all. They were OK except for the chili sauce, if you could call it that, which drenched all of the chips. The sauce had no spice, or taste for that matter, to it.  After we ate some of the chips because we were pretty hungry, we had to return them. Our server was very nice and apologetic about it. My dad's chicken tortilla soup (which I tried) was the definition of so-so. It tasted pretty good but was lukewarm which made it unappetizing.  I got the ""enlightened"" Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were disappointing to say the least: just lacking flavor overall. The grains that came on the side were even more flavorless than the tacos. And I agree with another review which highlights the ridiculous cost of the food, because my pretty small, devoid-of-flavor tacos were around $10.75. That's pretty ridiculous.  By and large, BJ's has let me down. I'm not sure if this was an abnormality, or if they're changing for the worst.

So then......we wait........ I wish I had kept track of how long it took because it felt like an eternity (especaiiyl since we were already so hungry).  Yes, it was a busy Friday night, but it was just ridiculous.  When the food finally arrived, he brought me the entirely wrong salad (something with tuna).  I was very unhappy at this point.  OH and also unhappy with the skinny margarita that tasted like fresh lemonade.  I tasted a hint of tequila at the beginning and then it was just lemonade.  I promise I am not exaggerating.  I would've complained but it would've taken 30 minutes just to get a new one.  I promise I do not like cocktails with too much liquor in them-it was like there was none in it.  So when my salad came out wrong, I was pretty upset.  I didn't complain.  OH and my son's cheeseburgers had no cheese.  We realized there was a mix up but the server tried to argue with me about it. When my salad comes out 15-20 minutes later, it is perfect.  So so good.  That's why this review has 2 stars and not 1.  Thank God for that salad.  And after we finished, the server didn't even ask if we wanted to have dessert (which for me was fine since I was full but my friend wanted a pizookie).  We also realized it would've taken forever so we just paid and left.

I decided to take one of my kids while my wife stayed at home with the other. Since I was planning on staying in the car I did not put a coat on my child even though it was 20 degrees outside.  After arriving 5 minutes early I called. After 10 minutes of the phone ringing I figured no one was going to pick up. I then called my wife and explained the situation. We already paid for the food online so could not just drive away. She then got into her car with my other child and drove to the restaurant. Since patrons who were eating at the restaurant took all the remaining curbside spaces she had to park across the lot and bring my 2 year old to my car so she could sit in the car with our other child and I could go inside. During this 15 minutes I was waiting I continued to keep my phone on and it rang for a total of 25 minutes. I then went inside and noticed 2 servers filling pick up orders. There was 1 person in line. They immediately asked me what I was to pick up. The phone was ringing non-stop and ignored the whole time. In the 5 minutes I was up there waiting for my order to be brought out no one answered the phone, it just kept ringing. Taking advantage of someone hanging up I called with my cell phone to carryout and it immediately rang and stopped when I hung up. This verified to me my calls were going through. In short. NEVER use the curb side pickup. Your calls will be ignored while the servers stand inside with a 2:1 ratio of people in line and servers. Also NEVER pay for your food upfront. This way you can always leave and just not pick it up if no one answers the phone. UPDATE: After the response below on 11/19 I emailed the listed address on 11/20. It is now 12/6. I have not received any response. After 16 days I do not expect a response from the company.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8,3.44,3.31,3.31,,3.362
14,Kevin S.,"Cleveland, OH",0,15,,4.0,2017-11-29,"I have been to this location several times and I have been to some of tbe other locations. The food is always good. It's not great, but good and very consistent. The menu is huge and has something for everyone. The deep dish pizza is very good. The Thai Peanut Noodles are very good, but a little small of a portion. They have decent burgers too. The beers are pretty good. The bar is a great place to sit and watch sports.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8,3.4,3.34,3.34,,3.3640000000000003
18,Kara S.,"North Olmsted, OH",26,11,,3.0,2017-12-11,Sat at bar and got great service! Food was just okay though. Pizza was served barely warm and fries were not freshly cooked. Have been to other BJs and really liked. This one was not on par.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8,3.48,3.34,3.34,,3.3960000000000004
4,Brandon L.,"Columbus, OH",38,550,12.0,2.0,2018-01-03,"The most recent experience, via take out, was disappointing. It wasn't too long that we had to wait....but the chicken seemed like it had been sitting under the lamp for a while. And the pizza? Pricey, sparse on toppings and a bit undercooked. Sure, ive had fairly good experiences dining in. I've had fish n chips, and pasta. Maybe you should just avoid the pizza and the chicken? The parking lot is always crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8,3.4,3.31,3.31,,3.346
3,Tracy W.,"Greenwich, OH",9,74,42.0,2.0,2018-01-04,"I ate here with a small group last evening for a business dinner. I must say I have been to BJ's several times, and have always thought highly of their menu selection and service. Tonight however the service was horrible and the food was not up to par. For a midweek evening, they were not extremely busy. Our waitress seem to have too many tables and was running around trying to keep up with the demands. There were five of us in our group. We each got our drink orders which was all simple as well as an appetizer which came out in decent time. We then ordered our entrées and some came out OK and some needing attention, however we had to wait for our waitress to come back. The rice mixture was extremely dry and we requested something different which did not come out until we were all done eating. We even told her to not bring it since the meal was over however she didn't listen and brought it out anyway. A couple of us ordered the small steaks which were just OK. We all thought overall the food quality was just not that great tonight. Our group has eaten here several times over the past few years without issue but something seemed off tonight. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what but it seem like every time we turn around we had to wait for something which should not have taken but a few minutes to take care of. Even our bill we received was wrong and belong to another table which really topped off the night on a wrong note.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-dublin-8,3.4,3.31,3.31,,3.346
