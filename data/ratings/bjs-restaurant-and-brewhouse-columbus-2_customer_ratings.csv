56,Matt P.,"Columbus, OH",54,201,497.0,4.0,2015-06-28,"Even thought this place just opened I didn't have any rookie issues with anyone. Seems to be running pretty smooth. It's located in the new Easton Gateway complex and has its own parking lot. It's pretty much the same as the Polaris location but maybe a little less space.  Regardless, I decided to try something off their enLIGHTened menu this time. Specifically the Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, but with added Cajun Shrimp. I'd suggest just asking for shrimp without seasoning. Perhaps for everything you get it added to. Something was a little off with all the flavors of the salad and I think it might have been that Cajun seasoning. Overall it was nice. Worth a try if you're into the whole kale trend and dig roasted brussels sprouts. Neither was overly bitter. Can't visit a BJ's without getting a beer, which they brew themselves, but not on location. I love their Hefeweizen-crisp taste but also a great aroma. I love just sitting there and smelling it. All locations also have seasonals throughout the year, like Pumpkin Ale and others for Oktoberfest and the winter months. They also have a gluten free berry cider as well. It's pretty refreshing and not as sweet as most. This ties in to their gluten free menu, which isn't that extensive but good that they have those options. I'm NOT Gluten free, mind you, but that salad I had was on that menu.  Definitely worth checking out one of their locations. Extensive food and drink menu that would be hard to not find something to enjoy. UPDATE: went back for dinner and got the ahi tuna salad and the sriracha brussels sprouts appetizer together. Also a pint of local CBC Summer Teeth beer. The salad was very good but the size of the tuna in the photo was definitely NOT what I got. A little bait and switch I feel. Also, it had small wasabi dollops in it, which I kept hitting and freaking out about. Needs to be mixed in better. WOW! Brussels sprouts were once again very good but you get a lot of them. Also, never, NEVER eat brussels sprouts twice in one day. Yikes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=40,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
55,Stephanie P.,"Dublin, OH",53,284,35.0,4.0,2015-06-30,"The Boy and I wandered in here last week after seeing that it had just opened. The place still had that ""new construction"" smell. There was a large number of staff floating around, probably due to trainers still onsite for the opening. This worked in our favor as everything was smooth as silk. We were seated as soon as we walked in, I expect this won't be possible again once word gets out that they are open. If you've been to a BJ's before, you're already familiar with the layout and menu. I opted for their seasonal beer (which was darn tasty) and the boy went for the blonde ale. We both went for new menu items. I tried the barbacoa chicken off the enLIGHTened menu. It is very good, nicely spiced and cooked perfectly. The Boy had the bbq brisket burger which looked amazing and he reports that it was very tasty. Our server (who, like most of the staff, was new) was prompt, polite and helpful.  They have a takeout door/counter, which seems like an excellent idea for the Easton area. Even though this is another chain, it is a welcome addition to the shopping plaza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=40,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

The server was nice and accommodating even after we changed up how we wanted the checks split.  The waits were a little long between refills.  Also, we were told our waitress would go over a rewards program, but she must have forgotten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=20,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004
46,Angie K.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,228,368.0,5.0,2015-07-26,"Great service, food, and beer. Overall was super happy with our dinner at BJ's. Their prices are spot on; just the right price for the portion and quality. One person at our table got the salmon over quinoa, and another got the mahi-mahi pineapple dish and they both raved about how tender and delicious their fish was (especially for a chain restaurant like this, we were amazed!). Pizzas: They list their pizzas as ""deep-dish,"" but this is really not true. BJ's pizzas are just SERVED in a deep dish, but they are actually pan pizzas. Real deep-dish has a thick crust with lots of sauce and toppings. BJ's pizzas are very light, buttery, flaky crust (i.e. pan pizza) with very little sauce. They did pile on the toppings, which I loved. So was expecting deep-dish, got pan pizza instead. Still awesome tasting, and will definitely get it again! Try the BJ's favorite or Gourmet Five Meat. Beer: Every single beer they brew is delicious. You can get pints, pitchers, or samplers of any beer on tap. They also have guest beers on draft.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=40,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001

93,Robert S.,"Chillicothe, OH",52,59,49.0,3.0,2015-08-09,Had a late lunch here today with a friend and was excited to try BJ's again since I had eaten one in Texas years ago. The hostess tried to seat us but the table wasn't ready yet so we were seated at a small booth for two. We both looked over the menu and both decided to order sirloin steaks. Our waitress took our order. My friend had ordered a wedge salad with no tomatoes. Salad came and it had tomatoes on it. She took the tomatoes off and ate the salad with no complaints. As we were finishing up our salads our waitress came by and asked us if we were ready for the check or did we want dessert??  I told her that we had not even had our main course yet. She looked at us like she was confused. She apologized and said she would check on our food. Food came in a reasonable amount of time and food runner asked us to cut into our steaks. I had ordered my medium and my friend has ordered hers medium well. Mine looked ok but my friends looked medium rare. The food runner apologized and took the steak back. When my friends steak came back it was prepared to her liking at medium well. I was disappointed in the steam asparagus. It was a very small portion and they did not have much seasoning on them. I also thought the sirloin was small for the price. The menu did not specify how many ounces you were to receive. Overall the steak had a good taste. If we go back we both agreed we would try a burger because s neighboring tables burgers looked good. I'm hoping that this new location is still working out all the kinks and will provide a better meal next time we come in. Overall a little less than average dining experience today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=80,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001
73,Bruce C.,"Columbus, OH",12,34,,2.0,2015-08-11,"I really liked this place (edit--this part of the review was after my first visit)  Good food, good beer, good service, nice atmosphere.  Negatives...not sure who decided it was as a good idea to have lights hanging in front of the televisions. Edited review. We have been back a few times, and none of our subsequent trips were up to the standards of the first one.   The service has been OK rather than good, and the food has been decent by not great. Tonight was the last straw for me.     My wife wanted to go here for her birthday dinner and I'm sorry we did.    We were there before 5:00 pm and it was pretty empty.  In spite of this, our server could not have been less attentive.   We were seated for at least 5 minutes before he stopped by our table.    It took another 10 minutes before we had our drinks and had a chance to order our food.   My meal was pretty mediocre, but I was extremely hungry and finished it without complaint.   After finishing our meals  we sat for fifteen minutes and didn't see our server at all.    We finally flagged down another waitress and asked for her assistance.    She tracked down our waiter.   He told us he was really busy with two parties behind us--BS, those parties consisted of maybe 10-12 people added together.     On top of the mediocre service, for some reason they felt that Fox News was an appropriate addition to their TV line-up.    Why would you devote so many of your tv's to a channel that is going to alienate a large percentage of your customers.    It was very distracting to try to watch a soccer match on one tv and have the one next to it spewing out political propaganda. Lowering my inital rating two stars for progressively worsening experience on each trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=60,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

It was perfectly seasoned chicken breast over greens with crunchy onions on top, along with some really tasty mashed potatoes. I enjoyed every bite.

Like put your order in and wait 20 minutes to get your drinks and 45 mins to get your appetizer slow. Dinner finally arrived after over an hour. All in all took about 2 hours. Thankfully we had no other plans. I think our server was new to serving.  We didn't see her much but she was nice when we did. Not helpful but nice. The food was okay and portions were good.

Great beer selection, I had a very nice waitress, had a nice time with family there but the food is over priced for what it is. It's like the food is good enough to be kinda fancy but not great enough to justify the price. Don't get me wrong my Jambalaya was good. The house salad was half a bowl.

52,Luke L.,"Columbus, OH",39,47,4.0,3.0,2015-11-19,"BJ's is one of the newest chain restaurants available in the Easton area. I would compare it to The Cheesecake Factory -- but with a better beer selection.  Like most chains....their menu caters to all different types of customers. It takes little risk and focuses on creating selections which are neither groundbreaking nor spectacular. This style of food service is not always a bad thing, however it does leave something to be desired by food connoisseur's seeking a revolutionary experience.  The service was great/cheerful and the ambiance is exactly what you should expect from a chain brewhouse. Overall, it is a good family or group destination for people who require many options.

65,Antonio T.,"Houston, TX",32,87,328.0,1.0,2015-11-20,"I really try to find the best in every situation, I really do And I generally regard myself as an optimist but, no matter how optimistic I may try to be, there was nothing positive that I can say about my experience here. For starters, I arrived at 7:30 PM and my order wasn't taken until 9:30 PM. Yes, I understand that it was a Friday night and yes I understand that it's in Easton which is a very popular part of town. But I also feel like the establishment should know that. And they should have more than enough people scheduled to work to accommodate the crowd. If you have more people working, people are seated quicker. Those same people then order faster and they eat faster and leave quicker. For me, it all boils down to being prepared. The drinks were ordered and there was a root beer that was placed on the table with absolutely no ice at all. Just root beer and a glass. I sampled a little bit of everyone's plate including the chicken tenders and fries, the fish and french fries, the brisket barbecue burger and my dish which was the baked ziti. The ziti was not cooked al dente. It tasted like it was rinsed in hot water and placed in the broiler. The top level of my pasta was crunchy. Pasta is never supposed to be crunchy. It tasted like someone had gotten some noodles,  poured some Ragu on it, sprinkled some cheese on top and brought it out. And to think they have the audacity to charge me $15 for this.

21,John R.,"Groveport, OH",4,23,10.0,2.0,2016-07-11,"I've been here before, and was not impressed then either. We had a coupon so we thought we would try it again. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which, on the menu picture looked very appetizing (attached). Looked like a nice grilled piece of chicken with a dry rub of sorts, Brussels sprouts, onions, and other veggies around it that look to be sautéed. The rice in the picture was also what appears to be white and dry (dry meaning no added sauces), with the food sitting atop. What I was served was completely different, it was a disgusting mass of soaked rice in what I can only describe as an oil bath. I took a close up of the food where I had cleared a small patch of the plate so you can see the oil running out of the rice/sauce, it's that yellow sheen there (also attached). Every grain of rice was COMPLETELY drenched in this oily sauce. It was heavy, and very unappetizing to look at. Very opposite of the ""Light"" dish it is on the menu as. Just my food in of itself deserved only 1 star (heck zero stars). But, saving one extra star was the cook on the chicken, as well as the staff. Chicken was cooked through, hot, and juicy. In addition, my wife's food was rather tasty, which I finished, since I did not eat anything but the chicken from mine (after scraping off the oily mess that it was soaked in). The staff was attentive, friendly, and the waiter was efficient with our order, refills and the check. The flavor was there, and this dish could be really good if it was as pictured, with a light amount of sauce atop a bed of fluffy white (DRY) rice (even brown rice would be a healthier alternative here, and might even get the dish below 500 calories if used instead). Instead it was as if they sautéed the veggies AND the chicken in the same pan with a TON of oil, and then just dumped ALL of it on the plate, rather than picking the veggies out of the sauce and leaving the excess sauce in the pan, which would have been ideal here.  After 2 strikes, I will likely need another coupon to come back to BJ's again, when that happens, hopefully they don't strike out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.408,2.88

We were told 40-50 minutes and so we agreed to wait. An hour later and with no table, I asked the host who told me THIRTEEN parties were ahead of us. When I pressed him why our estimated wait time was so off, he said something about call-aheads (what's the point of a wait time estimate if call-aheads are that much of a problem?!) He assured me we'd be seated soon. We commiserated with others waiting, who had all been told 30-50 minute wait times and now had been waiting for an hour or more.  After a 2 hour wait we were called. But THEN we were told that our table wasn't ready. They had accidentally given it to someone else. Cue more waiting. 2 hours and 15 minutes later, we were finally seated. Unfortunately there was no silverware or anything else at our table. More waiting.  When we finally ordered, they got our order wrong (my medium rare stake came well done...). The rest of our food was mediocre at best.  The apologies from the wait staff and manager were full of excuses and no one would take responsibility.  All told, after arriving at 6pm we left at 9:30!!! 3.5 hours later - and only about 20 minutes of that was spent actually eating. Horrible service, only ok food - this place is a waste of everyone's time and money.

The wait time was quoted to be around 25mins or so. There was a mix up in our seating and we waited for about 1.5hrs to get seated. We had requested a table vs. a booth, but there was plenty of opportunity to seat us before we hit 1.5hrs. They do come around with samples of pizza a couple times which was a nice gesture, but getting seated would have been better. Things happen, I know, but the fact that no one seemed to care that we were waiting that long is what was upsetting. An apology, a comp appetizer, or let us know that the tables at the bar were up for grabs! Cause others came in and just took those over.  Anyways, the food is always solid. Nothing fancy or pretentious, just good. They brew their own beers and sodas and that's really their big plus.  Would I go back?

7,Amy D.,"Lakewood, OH",114,72,179.0,2.0,2017-05-07,"I'm not in the habit of frequenting chain restaurants, but alas, sometimes it just is what it is.  I joined a group of colleagues here while visiting Columbus for a work-related trip. I didn't chose the restaurant, and probably wouldn't have based on the previous reviews. But my company was excellent so that made up for the sub-par food and sad service. To start, I joined a table of 5 other people, who had already ordered drinks and were snacking on guacamole and tortilla chips. Within a few minutes the server arrived, acknowledged my presence and offered to take my drink order. I placed my order and rejoined my friends in conversation. The server returned with the salads everyone had ordered before I arrived, but not my drinks. I asked her about them & she looked a little embarrassed and said the bar was backed up. She did return with my drink(s) a few minutes later and offered to replenish our tortilla chips, on the house. That's typically a good sign of customer service, in my experience.  One of my colleagues ordered an appetizer, some sort of southwestern tex-mex flatbread. It was actually pretty yummy and we all munched on it while waiting for our food. Perplexed by the 6428492 page menu, I ordered the sirloin to keep things simple. I should have headed the yelp! reviews ahead of me. The sirloin was about 6 ounces, and coated in some sort of seasoning that resembled Mrs. Dash. I honestly have no idea why one would feel the need to season a steak in this way. It's steak, it's supposed to be naturally delicious. No. Not this steak. It sat in my stomach all night like the dead cow that it was. It kept me up all night, refusing to digest. Oh, what an unhappy meal this was. The asparagus was equally over-seasoned, and the only saving grace where the white cheddar potatoes, which were obviously from some sort of prepared package, but tasty nonetheless. Now onto the sad service. I honestly felt so terrible for our poor, young server. She was so incredibly sweet, and tried her hardest to care for our needs, but she or the restaurant in general kept coming up short. Our food came out in waves, instead of altogether. My friend never got a salad she ordered at the same time as everyone else. My other friend never received a beer she ordered. I had to ask several times for a second glass of wine. When the checks came, my friend who ordered 2 double vodka soda's found that she was charged for 4 separate drinks at $8/piece. $32 for two drinks. After discussing it with her manager the server managed to get that corrected and instead the drinks were $10/piece.  All in all, there are many other restaurants in Columbus.

Today, I had lunch with a team from work, and everyone raved about how delicious their meals were. Although I don't review chains very often, I decided to write this review today because I thought my lunch was especially good. Before we left work to go to BJ's, I looked over the menu online. I was very pleased to see that they include the calories for each item. I looked over the menu carefully... everything sounded delicious, but there were a lot of dishes very high in calories. Fortunately, I also found several things in the 500-600 calorie range (and some even lower) that sounded delicious, too. I settled on the fire-roasted barbacoa chicken. This meal was off-the-charts delicious. The menu describes it this way: A barbacoa-spiced, marinated chicken breast served over brown rice and black beans, then topped with feta cheese, cilantro, crema and fire-roasted tomato salsa. (I saw on one version of the menu that the crema is made with Greek yogurt.) [520 calories] Everything in the dish was delicious, but the chicken especially stood out. It was so moist and tender, my fork cut through it like softened butter, and it was seasoned perfectly. I most definitely did not feel like I was skimping or missing out any by getting something with fewer calories. As I mentioned, everyone on my team was raving about how delicious their meals were, so I'm pretty certain five stars was the consensus, and many of them had also gotten lower calorie meals. Thanks, BJ's for offering such delicious options for those of us who want something with fewer calories and putting so much effort into making those options so delicious!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-columbus-2,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
