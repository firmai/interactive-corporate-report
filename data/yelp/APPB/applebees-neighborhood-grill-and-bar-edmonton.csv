Jenn T.,"Edmonton, Canada",38,277,463,5.0,11/10/2011,"I had always driven past this Applebees for awhile & finally decided to drop in for dinner before catching a movie at the local theatre. I have to say; I am quite glad I finally went in because I was not disappointed at all. I found the service to be prompt & friendly; the waitress came by often to ensure our drinks were full & we were satisfied with the food. They had large helpings of food; we had to take alot of it home because we couldn't finish even half. Although it did make good lunch for the next day. The food was so delicious, especially the dessert! (I tried the provolone stuffed meatballs with fettucine for my main course & the Chocolate Chip Sundae for my dessert.) The only downside was that it was a little pricey. Although they do also have a 2 for 1 option available. For the amount of helpings and the great taste of the food, the price is worth it, in my opinion. Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food so I would absolutely go again! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Brenda J.,"Edmonton, Canada",13,37,8,3.0,7/7/2011,"I was here yesterday for an early dinner with my bf, and grrr, this place is so inconsistent with their customer service. I can't do more than 3 stars!   I like the interesting memorabilia they have up all over the place. It is a casual feel, which I like as well. The carpeted areas could perhaps be a bit cleaner. The carpet just looks too beat up. Washrooms are in average shape. The ladies washroom could do with a fresher smell and cleaning more often. I do realize it is a family friendly restaurant, so all the more reason to get in there and clean the puddles of water on the counters, paper towels off the floor, etc. I do always like the food. I find the prices affordable and the meal portions to be large. I see their food as ""comfort food"". I am a meat and potato girl, and they provide plenty of options for that!  I usually have leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.  I love their alcoholic drink choices although they don't always look like picture, which I experienced yesterday. I ordered some kind of island-looking drink since my bf and I were yapping about the DR, and when it came, it was quite a let-down, BUT it did taste great and was perfect on a hot afternoon.  I would have liked some more personality,interest, and attentiveness from our waitress. She asked my bf if he wanted gravy with his fries, and he said no, yet gravy appeared with our meal AND on the bill. She was clearly going through the motions, didn't make much eye contact, and that was also a bit of a let down. I will still be going back, but I wish the service was more consistent. I have been here plenty of times and had spectacular service, so I tend to want that every time! heehee",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Kevin M.,"Edmonton, Canada",1,6,1,3.0,7/1/2012,"First impressions didn't give me any confidence in this restaurant. Table was still dirty when I was seated, and the floor was filthy. Honey bbq chicken bites were rather good not something I would reorder though. Onion rings were amazing. entree was a bourbon chicken and shrimp, very full of flavor and delicious, will certainly come back again for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Kristin K.,"Edmonton, Canada",518,1215,7575,2.0,12/23/2011,"My family has eaten at this location numerous times - service is a crap shoot and food is typically subpar.  My husband and I both received food poisoning from this particular location once after half price appetizers on a Sunday evening.  I phoned the restaurant to let them know, once I was human again and I don't recall them being too particularly concerned.  I don't think we will ever return to this location... For the price - we can easily find better and more consistent food elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Jessica T.,"Edmonton, Canada",5,14,,4.0,5/18/2011,"My boyfriend and I are regulars at our local apple bees and we love it!  The waitresses are prompt and kind and the service is great! The food is even better, we cannot go without ordering the chicken wonton tacos we actually go on appetizer night ( 2 for 1) and get plates of wonton taco because they are just to dye for!  I am a huge fan of there ribs, asiago chicken dish and boy friend loves the pulled pork sandwich's but everything we've ever got is always a hit!  The price is right for this food and service.  The decor is fun and very Edmonton based with displays of all of the college and universities sports teams displayed and also some great old movie memorabilia, there is always something fun to check out.    I would definitely recommend popping by and don't forget to try the wonton tacos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Eryn S.,"Edmonton, Canada",10,28,,3.0,12/9/2012,"Applebee's is usually pretty tasty! I went with 3 friends this past Saturday. The wait time was 15 minutes, which was fine. We were seated by the bar, our first waitress didn't have any idea about the drink or food menu, which was kind of a let down- me not being able to eat gluten I just wanted to know if the French fries and chicken were deep fried in the same oil. But she put up a ""huff"" having to go to the kitchen to ask..The bartender came up to us and said he would be serving us after waiting for 20 minutes at the table. After that little mishap  dinner went uphill. We all enjoyed our food, our drinks and good company in a good atmosphere!  Definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Rob M.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,12,,3.0,3/30/2011,The first time I stopped here the service plain SUCKED.  I complained to management and they gave me a credit to come back and try it again.  I returned about 3 months later and could not have had a more opposite expereince.  The service was prompt and courtesous and the food was good.   The atmosphere is a bit stale - old faded pictures and worn seats but the food and service were fine.  I would return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Rose-marie L.,"Edmonton, Canada",69,102,,4.0,12/31/2011,"I've been to Applebee's in the past and was not to impressed by it. But we came in last night and ordered an appy and main's for both of us, and it was really good.  We started off with the Chicken Won Ton Taco's and these were EXCELLENT, if we hadn't ordered our main course we would of had a double order of these instead. Hubbs got the Clubhouse Sandwich and fries, I got the Double Crusted Shrimp , both were really good and filling we were waddling out the door with our over stuffed bellies. We will for sure be back, now that food and service have improved from our last visit. The Desserts looked really good too , but no room.  Maybe next time..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
Lauren N.,"Edmonton, Canada",103,593,669,3.0,11/4/2008,"I came to this Applebee's once after a late movie at the Clareview movie theatre. It has a laid-back, no frills atmosphere, just good wholesome comfort food. Actually, it feels like I'm in an old friend's well-furnished basement, just kicking back and having fun. The food strikes me as a cross between Denny's and Chili's or Boston Pizza. It's typical late-night food that isn't that good for you, but it tastes great late at night. I love buffalo wings, so I ordered the honey bbq ones. What I like about the wings here is that they're boneless, so it makes for easier (and less messier) eating. And my friend likes getting a side of healthy celery sticks with her wings (I think it makes her feel less guilty), so that's what she liked about Applebee's. I've only had the wings, so I can't vouch for anything else on the Applebee's menu. I thought the prices for their appies were a little bit high though, since they were about the same as some of their entrees. Maybe it's just me, but I think appies should generally be cheaper. Anyway, Applebee's probably wouldn't be my first pick for another late-night outing, but I wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the neighbourhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-edmonton
