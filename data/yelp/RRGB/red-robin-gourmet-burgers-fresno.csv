Steffie P.,"Fresno, CA",3,58,87,4.0,1/14/2018,"My family and I came in on a Saturday evening for dinner. The restaurant was super busy. We waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. Our server Camille was amazing! I've never had such great service at a Red Robin. She went above and beyond and really tried to make sure we were all happy. The food itself was pretty good. The fries are my favorite. I got the California chicken burger. It was good but didn't have much guacamole on it. I noticed the buns are a little different. They tend to fall apart more and seem a little cheap. I wish they would change that because they stuff so much into the burgers that the buns can't handle it. Any who, my family and I love coming to Red Robin, mainly for the fries so we'll be back even if their buns are crappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno
Jeanine H.,"Clovis, CA",51,4,1,1.0,11/6/2017,"Party of 10 given a 30 min wait that was close to 50. 2 of our meals weren't entere d in ti the order and arrived way late. One meal was severly over cooked.  The worst part of our experience was mine...  Dining out as a vegetarian is always questionable and I realize the risk. Tonight I bit, chewed and swallowed a large piece of chicken on my lettuce wrapped veggie burger- weird large chunk that certainly didn't belong. I consumed chicken after 20 years of not eating meat. Absolutely dumbfounded. Over it! No more Red Robin for me. Vegetarian  orders should be treated in the same manner allergy orders are!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno
Lily V.,"Fresno, CA",0,45,217,4.0,1/14/2018,"Very family friendly. Nice that the kid meals come with unlimited portions of their sides and drink choices. And that there is an activity menu/page to keep them occupied, especially when the wait on our last visit took a while to get out. The waitress was very friendly and patient with our table; Our orders came out correctly, but the kid's meals were incorrect in that the sides were the wrong choices and the preference forgotten.

Lorraine C.,"Selma, CA",156,261,1757,4.0,5/6/2017,"Great place to drop in and grab a burger and fries....or in my case a chicken burger and fries. I don't know if it's just because I was one of the first customers of the day but I was treated awesomely and the food was the best it's ever been. Whatever the case may be, everything was on point today. I didn't even mind paying the $1.99 entertainment fee to play some games with my son.  My California chicken burger was cooked to perfection. The bacon was crispy, the avocado was fresh and ripe, the cheese was melty .... yum. I also upgraded to garlic fries which were also amazing! My son had the pizza and it looked tasty.  My server was nice. She had a great attitude and had a positive vibe about her. I like visits like these.

Nicola B.,"Fresno, CA",656,517,1232,3.0,12/12/2016,"My husband and I come here more than I care to admit! You know what you're getting here, it's easy, it's casual, and it's pretty cheap.  For starters we usually go for a combo of zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks - all the healthy stuff, right?! Then for mains I usually switch it up. The crispy chicken burger is good, always really crispy as advertised, hot, a generous sized piece of meat. The bun doesn't fall apart, and it's pretty filling. The whisky river chicken burger is good too. I sometimes go for a salad or the whisky river chicken wrap for something a bit lighter. Fries are bottomless, so they give you a smaller portion than they used to but will always bring more if you ask. My husband's a fan of the burnin' love burger. The menu is really extensive but the burgers are definitely the highlight. The bar has good options, several beers on tap, and a decent selection of liquors (including more than 2 kinds of gin, which I appreciate!). There are a ton of sugary cocktails on offer, though not my scene. I can't recommend its wine selection, though they do have a sangria thing that does the job if you want to walk the line between wine and booze. The milkshakes are really good, and they'll give you the leftovers in a silver cup along with the main event which is perfect for sharing. It's not gonna blow your socks off, but if you want some burgers and fries and a drink you probably won't walk away disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno

I ordered the grilled chicken teriyaki sandwhich, it was dripping in mayo and they just threw a piece of pineapple from a can in it. Really? They couldn't even grill it at least !?

I know my dad hated the fact that he kept pushing him to use the table tablet. Lol. Mozzarella sticks for appetizers. They were really good. My dad and boyfriend ordered salads. They seemed to like it. They didn't say anything bad about it, which is good I guess? I'm fat/pregnant so I got the ghost pepper burger thing with the endless fries. I expected the burger to be spicier. I was surprised by how many jalapeños they put on this thing though. They put some on the bottom bun, in between the 2 patties, and on top. Putting 20 jalapeños on something isn't going to make it any spicier. It's just going to taste like jalapeño.  Like, I wanted this burger with some jalapeño. But it's like I got jalapeños, with some burger. Lol. Regardless, after picking off half of them, it was a good burger. The fries were okay.

Jesus Christ!!!  If the fries are cold don't bring them!!! First ones on the side of my burger:  COLD Reorder:  eh....warm.  Finish those (they only brought like....5 fries) and order another.

Sak V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",3,200,105,3.0,2/28/2017,"Deciding what to eat is pretty hard here in The ""Central Valley"" because the chains here is either a hit or a miss or a big disappointment. So I gave Red Robin and shot and it wasn't that bad but it seems you have to wait almost an eternity for your burger. I had the following today Big Tavern Burger 4/5 taste pretty good but it took them awhile to make my single patty burger Short order onions rings 3/5 so it's basically almost $1.00 for each onion rings nice taste and crunch but kinda oily  Steak fries 3/5 found hair on my fries but it didn't stop me from eating part of them they claim they use north western potatoes but I couldn't find anything special or anything stands out Service 4/5 my server kept on refilling my drink which was a good thing Freckle lemonade 2/5 basically your minute made from the soda fountain with strawberries, it was watered down  Red Robin is good place for getting burgers and steak fries but I still prefer Ruth Chris or Flemings during their happy hour. The only thing that was kinda irritating was waiting for the burger it them longer than usual for a single ""big patty"" Tavern burger while the place was not packed at all. So for $20.00 without adding my server the $6.00 tip Red Robin makes good burgers and it doesn't cost you and arm and leg to eat here just the waiting makes you wonder should you come back Next time?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=20

The cup of soup is super small and was basically 5 soup spoonfuls. The BLTA Croissant didn't settle well in my stomach that night.

The food runners were touching the food (yes with bare dirty hands)looking at what kind of burgers were on the plates so they could take them to the appropriate tables, one of the ladies actually took food from a silver bin that the kitchen staff slide thru the pass Thru, it look like chicken strips to me?

My biggest gripe is with the amount and frequency of their ""Bottomless fries"". They give you maybe 10 steak fries at a time, and when you ask for more, it takes about 10 minutes before they bring them to you. So in all reality, you're looking at maybe 20 fries during your whole meal. They also seem to have the same policy about refills (ever on water). I suspect this is a dirty money-saving tactic. It's sad because I would probably come here a couple times a month if they had good service.

Peggy P.,"Selma, CA",39,8,3,1.0,8/20/2015,"Very disappointing experience here at the River Park location. The Gourmet Burgers looked nothing like the menu. The service was slow and the so called ""Gourmet"" burgers were a big disappoint! They were small, served lukewarm, like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp. I ordered the sweet potato fries and even THEY were lukewarm. I had to send MY burger back because it was uncooked in the center. They brought me more fries while I waited and those fries were fresh, hot and delicious. The bad part was they took FOREVER to bring my burger and by the time they did, all my friends were finished with their meals. The quality and portion size were NOT worth the BIG price tag.

But when I got my food I was even more upset because my sandwich had no lettuce at all it only had like literally 3 slices and my mom's had a handful and I was really sad. The only thing I was happy about was when the waitress kept bringing fries so that was a plus. The last thing I was upset about was that she had asked if we needed refills and she was saying it to my dad and I said sure, she looked at me like I was crazy because my glass had a quarter of water left and I was like geez didn't need to give me that look but she still brought me one.

Mushrooms, grilled onion crisp, tasty burger, onion bun. It's salty but good. There usually fluffy meaty steak burgers came a bit too done this time, but fries are not consistent anywhere so it must have been the batch. I could have, should have asked for a new bunch but I was so full from my burger. New for me was the Italian soda. A bit too sweet, but still ok. If you have not been in awhile they have made some changes, and still getting used to. Also $75 with tip for family of 4 for a burger joint is steep.

Walk in and the bar is hidden away to the left by all the TV's and plenty of seating (I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table here) To the back is the kitchen with glass front that allows you to see the cooks working hard... or is it hardly working!!  Seriously though the new menu is awesome! Spicy Thai sauce and ranch on the basket of fries is a big reason why we love you Red Robin!! I get the Royal Red Robin Burger and I am continually impressed! Although over the years the serving size of fries they give you for the ""bottomless"" fries has gotten smaller, its bottomless, so we still get our fix!! Chicken salads are huge and the Caesar  wraps on funky green tortillas are bomb too!  Great job Red Robin for not dropping the ball after over 10 yrs!

I was really hoping for a better experience since my last visit, but every time we've dined here, it seems understaffed and we usually have to wait a long time before our food comes out. It didn't seem to be all that busy tonight, yet it took them at least 25 minutes to buss the table across from us that was empty since before we sat down. My husband's fish sandwich was tasty, but I can't say the same for what I got. I ordered the soup and salad combo, and although my clam chowder was good, I cannot say the same about my salad. It had a funky taste to it, like it had been sitting in the refrigerator all day. Not fresh at all! I didn't send it back because we had already waited so long for our food and being that we had our two young daughter's with us, it was any minute before they got anxious, so I just ate it anyway. Well, BIG mistake. I ended up having a really bad stomachache when I got home and then throwing up a few hours later.

We got there at about 745-8pm, as we waited for a few others to join us. We waited about 7-8 minutes for a server to come to our table to get out drinks going, (and that was from one server) next, 8 minutes later, I finally got my freckled lemonade, (from a different server), 9 minutes later, (a third server came to our table) and had asked if we wanted any appetizers, yet, he did not even take our order, he said he will send our server over to our table, (which we were unsure of who our server was since we had so many people come to us.) 6 minutes later, a woman named jasmine who was our server came to take our appetizers order. Our guests got there, & waited for her for at least 10 minutes to come to grab their drinks. As one of our guests ordered a freckled lemonade, it looked like water & tasted nothing like my drink. So, we waited to try to grab her to tell her he just wanted a water, still no where to be around or found, so we grabbed the manager to get it for us. We then placed our orders, I ordered the whiskey river BBQ salad, and my father did as well. Didn't take too long at all for our food, that was the good part. She brought us our food, and I received a salad and my father received a burger, which was not what we ordered. The manager then fixed that for us and apologized, fixed his order, and told us our server will not be back that he will be taking care of us for the rest of the evening. (Whoo! He was awesome!) she later came back, and after everyone was half way done eating, my father and I did not even start yet, because I asked for a fork for us to eat our salads with and she eventually brought us one. Asked for extra napkins and utensils, she brings us one napkin and a bunch of knives, (she could have at least brought us some scissors so we could cut the napkin into 5 pieces.) we were all very disappointed at this time, the manager took over, & we had eaten. The waitress had the brought us boxes, (which I really didn't want to even take my food home it was so bad.) and she said, ""I'm not sure what the problem here was or what I did wrong, but my manager took 46$ off of your bill for whatever reason that was."" I was in awe that a server would say that to a customer. I, myself, am a server, and would not EVER say that to a customer. Ever. Extremely rude!

I'm so impressed with the service here I thought I'd be able to finish this before anything got here but I already have my margarita and my appetizers.

The service is incredibly slow and nonexistent at times throughout the meal. The manager wants to blame things on the server when clearly there is not enough staff to cover all the tables. To me, unlimited fries and refills means unlimited. When the server is barely ever coming to the table, then I have to go the whole meal with out refilled drink and fries. When ordering, if ordering gets too specific, be prepared to receive attitude from the servers, because like I said previously, they are already understaffed. I miss the days when servers were like friends, the food was delicious, the refills came as soon as they needed to be there, and you got more than five fries as a refill. Hopefully it improves.

Josiah B.,"Boise, ID",0,32,22,3.0,6/24/2013,"I'll just start off with the food was great as always!  Tried the promo Burserker burger and it was deeelicious!  That being said, here's the digs... The greeting/hostess staff at this location were impersonal and every employee that walked in and clocked in for their shift looked like they were going to work at the morgue or something.  We were hardly payed attention to during our waiting for a seat.  This was our first time to this location.  We arrived for lunch at 11:30 and there was a restaurant full of empty tables but for some reason had to wait 10 minutes.  How could this many tables be open without the opportunity to start dining?!  And this wasn't even explained to us while we had to wait.  We sat there confused, frustrated, and almost walked out.  We really wanted Red Robin for lunch and we've always enjoyed RR restaurants and our past experiences at them.  Needless to say, as we were finally getting brought to our table, there was an employee sleeping at the table next to us.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!!!  How unprofessional can you be?  I was pretty upset at this point and mentioned to our waitress how unprofessional that was and she told us that this employee works 2 jobs and that she's tired.  WOW!!!  But she did finally tell the girl and she moved to the other side of the restaurant after she glared at my wife.  Way to go super tired employee, maybe you should sleep in your car so nobody has to actually bring up the fact that you're sleeping in the restaurant that people are eating in!!!  WTF?!!!  I observed the manager throughout our dining experience and he was about as friendly as a fence post.  I've never been to a Red Robin like this.  Usually everyone is upbeat and helpful and respectful.  It just shows that a crappy manager with no excitement doesn't challenge his staff to be at that level either.  It's as if he didn't care about what was going on.  Very sad!  Also, the hostess didn't say anything to us as we walked past her while we were leaving...go figure, this was the champ that reflected the excitement of the manager so I wasn't shocked not hearing, ""Have a great day!"", or ""Thanks for coming in!""  But lastly, our waitress ended up doing a fantastic job, our food was delicious as always, and we were paid attention to throughout the rest of our time there.  I would love to recommend this Red Robin but it needs to be kicked up a notch before I ever go back in there.  First impressions are everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140

Sheila C.,"Fresno, CA",388,361,,4.0,12/28/2008,I pretty much am good here. Its burgers...they are good but I really like their bar actually. Decent drinks and they have some cool creations nice place to do a happy hour with friends or coworkers if you are trying to keep it casual and grab a low key dinner or something. Service overall is decent.  Dont come here expecting some stellar food experience come on it is a chain burger joint. come for food thats better then the fast food sort and a chill atmosphere. Oh and if you are a big eater you get unlimited fries and drinks....SCARF AND CHUG hahah Note: This place gets pretty packed on nights that FSU is having a game.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140
Lloyd L.,"Butte, MT",0,7,,1.0,9/4/2012,"Pour service from from server and pour service from manager.  waited over 10+ min. for refills had to get up and go to bar to get service, as I walked to the bar from the other side of the restaurant I noticed all the servers in the prep area talking, also notice 4 servers in the bar chatting away and eating.  during this whole time the manager was in the kitchen talking, none of the servers attempted to ask me if I need help, they looked at me and kept going on with there conversations.  The only helpful person was the gentleman attending the bar.  When I brought this to the managers attention he made a bunch of excuses into why the service was so atrocious,  I pointed out that there are servers standing there doing nothing and not looking over the restaurant to see who need assistance.  Then the manager asked me what should he do, as a guest I should not need to explain to a manager what to do, I believe that a manager needs to know how to deal with any situation that comes along.  When I went to pay for my tab the server dropped it on the table and disappeared not to be seen again, and her attitude when dropping it off was very unprofessional and uncalled for.  It was almost like she wanted to be fired.   The worst part is this is an ongoing problem at all the Red Robins I have been to.  I would of given them 0 stars but the food was good.   I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140

Timothy O.,"San Diego, CA",136,576,,3.0,7/2/2007,"If you're a nationwide chain of casual dining restaurants, and you don't have a franchise on Blackstone Avenue in Fresno, you're just not trying. The servers here at Red Robin are trying. They're trying to get families seated, trying to get everyone their burgers and chicken sandwiches, trying to refill the baskets of ""bottomless fries"" at every table. I'm trying to figure out why I want to spend $15 (including tip) for an (admittedly tasty) chicken sandwich, some steak fries, and a soft drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140
Tristin M.,"Fresno, CA",19,21,1,3.0,1/8/2010,"This is a pretty standard chain burger joint. The burgers are decent but far from the best I have ever had, but also far from the worst. The wait staff typically is on the ball however I have had a few bad experiences. Overall, pretty typical, nothing to write home about. I personally am not the biggest fan of mass market chain restaurants but this is far from the worst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140
Mike H.,"Fresno, CA",0,18,,3.0,8/11/2010,Price is great.  Service is always pretty bad as well as the feeling that you get from the staff.  Just wait til you get sat right next to the server station in the back that everyone sits at and gripes about their job... Terrible experience.  Burgers are ok and fries are good when they're fresh.  Servers down-sell while order taking... Not good for business..  I appreciated it tho ;),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140
Crystal C.,"Fresno, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/2/2011,The service was good our waitress was very attentive and made sure our drinks were filled.I had the burning love burger and it was excellent not too pink. However the fries were overly salty and cold. The atmosphere was nice it was not too loud even though we were seated in the bar area. They had happy hour going on so I took advantage and ordered a strawberry margarita. Overall it was a good experience and I would not mind going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140
Jacob S.,"Fresno, CA",0,15,,4.0,10/9/2008,"Yes, Red Robin is a national chain.  Yes you are going to get a pretty standard vanilla experience as far as atmosphere and service goes at any of them.  I do have to say though that Red Robins menu is probably my favorite out of any of the casual dining burger places.  They have done a really good job with some of their signature sandwiches like the Royal Red Robin Burger and the Whiskey River Burger and Chicken Sandwich.  It is a great place to go also if you are going with a group of people as everyone is going to be able to find something decent on the menu.  So, no, it is not the great secret find of Fresno, but it accomplishes its goal better then most of the other national casual chains I feel like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140
