0,David H.,"Augusta, ME",75,37,68.0,3.0,2012-06-15,"Friday's is located in a plaza with Best Buy, Ruby Tuesday, and Longhorn Steakhouse. Buffalo Wild Wings is located across the street. Expect your typical chain restaurant experience. The menu is large and varied, and they have a great 2 for $10 (entree and app OR dessert) deal that doesn't get advertised enough.  One of my favorite features is that unlike a lot  their competitors, happy hour goes until 7pm. Each day of the week features $5 or $6 drink specials. The staff are friendly and courteous, but the crowds can be sometimes unpredictable. One minute they can look like they're overstaffed and the next it becomes clear they are understaffed. The service can suffer as a result, but they do a great job compensating for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn,,,,,

2,Matthew H.,"Auburn, ME",0,3,,1.0,2014-02-01,Bar is ok but other then that it's just ok. Servers don't seam to have the sense of time took 15 just to order. The nicest staff member was the host. Waiter did even come to check on us. Will not be going back at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-auburn,,,,,
