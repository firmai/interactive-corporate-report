I also made great money working at CF. The high table turn time and moderately sized section helped this. CF does not take reservations, but sits guests on a first come first serve basis to make sure your section is never being wasted. The majority of CFs are located at a mall where the flow of drive-bys and walk-ins is ever constant. CF is very good about promoting internally as well. Although this is an opportunity not presented to myself in my time there, many servers/bakery workers have been promoted to management.","A very large restaurant comes with the cons of just that....large sections. Diverse clientele. Minimal attention from management as they are usually running around with more work than one can handle. You are also working with a very large staff that you must interact and learn how to work with a lot of coworkers. You are also working on other peoples time.

I shouldn't have to wait until Friday to know if I'm free the following Friday - employees have lives too and they'd like to be able to plan their time. It's obviously management's laziness, and since there are 7 managers at any given time there's no way one can't take the extra time to just set the schedule. If you don't care about your employees time and work/life balance then don't pretend to care about your employees at all. Good luck requesting off ever - it won't happen.<br><br>In terms of why it is awful to be a server - most of the ""extra steps of service"" are asinine and actually take away from the customer's experience because if a customer wants a straw they shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes for their server to get it for them because they have to consolidate steps and have to get a bev nap to present the straw to the customer because god forbid you just have wrapped straws in your apron and you can't automatically give them a straw even though every customer wants one. It's a restaurant and yet they don't understand the basic wants and needs of the average customer.",Do everything differently.

Like a lot of restaurants, who you work with can either make your shift amazing or a nightmare, especially with the managers. Hard work is not appropriately recognized, and even if you work hard and give it 110%, most of the time the managers do not acknowledge it or reward you. The bussers are consistently overstaffed, which means you make less money and have a lot of dead time. Because of this, the managers will make you look busy instead of scheduling the right number of people. The dish crew is always running behind, and the managers will make you rack and run your own silverware if they get really behind. Also, when you work a double or help a manger, you'll get a green ticket which you use to get free food. The problem with this is that people who are friends with the managers will get green tickets without even doing anything. Finally, if you wish to move up in the company, you have to have a very flexible schedule. They hold classes for servers/bartenders once every 3-6 months. The class spans over a week and a half with most of them being morning classes.

Managers are extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling, there are great opportunities for advancement, and servers, bussers, line cooks, kitchen managers and restaurant managers are friendly and promote a fun and safe working environment. This was easily the best company I have ever worked for in the restaurant industry, and I have been doing this for over 9 years. The opportunity for advancement is second-to-none. As a matter of fact, we, as managers were expected to be constantly training ourselves for promotions. I never heard of any manager that had worked for the company for multiple years that was not promoted. They encourage you to learn as much as you can about the food, culture, and systems. Staff are allowed free soup and bread (something you won't always find at other chains) and there's a meal program that takes a small amount of money out of your paycheck each day that you work and allows you to order most of the items on the menu (because just about everyone would take advantage of ordering the high priced items like the filet mignon or the ribeye). I will sorely miss the people, the managers, and the general attitude of every person I worked with, met, and became friends with while I was employed. Cheesecake Rocks!","The fast pace can be too much for some people and the hours can be long and arduous. As an example, I, as a kitchen manager, worked around 11-14 hours a day and it was exhausting. It was difficult to find the right work/life balance and ultimately I chose life over work. A lot of people in management, because of the long hours and having to work sometimes at home, reported their relationships with their significant other deteriorated and/or ended. While I was there, one of the kitchen managers was going through a rough divorce and a restaurant manager told me about how his wife divorced him because he became a workaholic and he ultimately had to step down as his role as the general manager and was demoted.",The benefits package that came with my salary were great. Bonuses were based on the overall performance of all the managers.

Only comp for actual issues (burnt, undercooked, something was in the dish, food quality). We've become the place that scam artists love to come to because they know they can get something for free if they complain. I've seen people eat almost an entire dish, say they just didn't like it and get it for free. Are you kidding me? Also figure out the fries situation and always have runner friendly food. We shouldn't have to call for fries, the kitchen should be constantly be cooking new batches (especially on a busy night) and should plate them and then bump the item on the screen as ready to be run. Not bump the item and then make the fries so the person running the food waits for 3/4 min (which feels like 3/4hrs) and their guests are wondering where they are.

You can see some really really low tip percentages, but usually those shifts come with really high sales, so at the end of the night you still make a good amount of money, but it can be really brutal at times. It's not a place where you do $500 in sales and have a 25% tip percentage, more like $1800 in sales with a 12% tip percentage. Also, the tip out is a total of 4.5% of your sales, which is a bit higher than most places, however in that restaurant you really rely on the help of the rest of your team.","Try to focus more on individual praise.

So if a random person is a secret shopper, a person who can get a free meal through contacting the company through the internet, and they liked or disliked your service, they can and will be filed in your report. If you get 3 below 70% no matter the time span, then you are fired. If you're a good employee or not. Corporate gives no exceptions, and managers don't even check to see , they take the guests word for true no matter if they lied or not.<br>The guests can say whatever they want and are always viewed as correct over the actual employee, the guests side will always be listened to, the employees won't- shouldn't it be the other way? A guest can leave, and often does, leave no tip, employees are not allowed to ask if there was a problem with the service, or they will be fired, and a manager will never stick up for the employee and ask if there was a problem to the guest. Basically the guest can always get their way, including getting their meal for free no matter what the complaint. The employee is secondary, but without the employee there would be no guests!","To genuinely listen to the employees. Yes, there is a large turn around in staff, but mainly because of these reasons, employees don't feel supported, and are assumed that it was the employees fault, when that is largely not the case. If an employee gets a bad CTS report, then it is weighed 100%, but should be more so 50-60%. A manager should then sit down in the employees section and be waited on to see for themselves if the employee is doing their job correctly. The rules in the CTS report are too unrealistic since tables are triple seated 2 out of 3 times, no matter how many times this is brought up. Only because management is pressuring the front desk to seat quickly, thus the root of the source is management. Since the cheesecake Factory is family style food, and portions are ridiculously large it attracts lower income families, that for the food sold it does not match the money made, since people are not aware, or ignorant to tipping, so the management should support the staff and question if the service was good if no tip was left. Or include an 18% gratuity automatically to every table. Also within the company to claim 12% at the end of each shift is mandatory, even if that money was not made, which is illegal."
