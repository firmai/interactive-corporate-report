Stacy L.,"Kansas City, MO",41,150,1,4.0,9/23/2011,"My first visit to a CPK & it was good.  A little over-priced, but the food was delicious.  And talk about service, I had 3 people ask me if I needed something to drink after I sat down.  Truthfully, it was almost enough to make me leave.  I appreciate good service, but feeling smothered is a different story.  My friend & I shared a full size salad & a pizza.  Way too much food.  We were unable to finish.  The candied walnuts on the salad were totally addicting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city?start=20
Kev L.,"Centerville, OH",245,658,146,4.0,11/19/2008,"Pretty good pizza.  Went with a group of friends. Wait was not bad for a Saturday night, however the quarters are rather tight, and in consequence, so was our seating.  Our server was very courteous and had an extra deal of patience dealing with the fact that 90% of us were total noobs and needed a bit of hand holding through the menu.  We had the Thai Chicken and Mango Tandoori pizzas. Both had really good crust and extremely flavorful toppings. Surprisingly enough, the pizza is very crave able and stacks up pretty good to a good few of the pizza joints here in KC. I will definitely go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city?start=20
iamnottelling n.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,1.0,10/16/2011,"just a warning, some waitress or waiter likes to publish customers names to a database if they do not tip enough I would only pay in cash at this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city?start=20
Kate V.,"Overland Park, KS",34,117,5,4.0,2/1/2009,"I was surprised how much I liked this place, and now I regularly buy their frozen pizzas from the grocery store. The Japanese eggplant & feta veggie pizza with honey-wheat crust is to die for, but I've liked everything I've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city?start=20
Jason O.,"Kansas City, MO",2,16,,3.0,3/18/2010,"I try to avoid going to chains, but I was invited to go along with family and who can turn down a free meal. First of all I'm not a Plaza person, I find more in common with the panhandlers than I do with the general Plaza patron (not that I'm that close to the panhandlers either). It's an area of town that is nicely maintained but just isn't for me. California Pizza Kitchen sits right in the middle of the Plaza, neatly nestled next to Victoria's secret. The food is really pretty good with a wide selection of different pizzas & appetizers. The general idea is that you order a pizza for yourself, which is about a ten inch pizza. I say this is the idea because when a person orders a pizza here the waitress/waiter is going to ask the others at the table what they are going to have, so, it's implied that your not ordering a pizza for you & your company but that they will also order a pizza or something for themselves. I have had the barbeque chicken pizza & the thai chicken pizza's and also the santa fe spring rolls, an appetizer, as well. this time I had the sesame ginger chicken dumplings. All the food that i've had has been really very good, the sauce with the chicken dumplings in particular, was fantastic. The restaurant is clean & neat & the staff is professional most items are maybe a little more expensive than I think they should be but that's really up for debate. My issue with the restaurant isn't really that anything I've had has been bad or that I haven't been served properly, It's just that it all just seems so robotic. Of the many times I have been there I just can't say that I've ever had a really memorable experience there, it's just food for the moment. What should I be expecting you ask? Well when it all adds up to about 62.00 for a table of four (one pizza, two appetizers, one soup, one wedge salad) it seems like I could have had a more memorable experience somewhere else. If your looking for a clean place with reliably good food that you can go to rest & eat in order to return to shopping, this place could be just right for you. It's probably one of the few places that is appropriate for kids also, but I wouldn't take a date there & it isn't really for you if you are looking for a dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city?start=20
Alyssa R.,"Kansas City, MO",91,81,97,4.0,1/27/2014,This pizza is really good. It's more upscale so you see people dressed nicer than eating at a regular pizza place but I like it.  I've gotten the BBQ Chicken pizza and it is amazing! It was fresh and the crust was perfect. The toppings were good I would just recommend asking for more cheese! The service was good however you are paying more for quality than an actual pizza size. Tastes good but can probably still survive for dessert afterwards.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Cindy R.,"Kansas City, MO",116,361,353,3.0,1/24/2014,"Brought my ""Little"" here last week for a little dinner and I was surprised that it was absolutely dead... Actually, it's Restaurant Week in KC and they don't have any specials so it's not THAT surprising. The service was great... the food was just ""sub par"" in my opinion. I ordered off the small plates menu since it was still Happy Hour and ended up with a wedge salad and a flatbread pizza.  I think the pizza was lacking something but I can't think of it at this moment and the salad was kinda blah.  Everything was fresh though. My ""Little"" ordered off the kids menu, pasta with tomato sauce, and seemed to really enjoy it.  I don't know many 12 year old kids who don't like pasta with tomato sauce though.    CPK is good but if I'm going for a more ""adult"" pizza, I'd pick some place else.  Kids love it though! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Carly N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",228,613,3460,5.0,2/18/2013,"I love this plaza CPK location! I've been here many times over the years and have never been disappointed! The restaurant is always clean and classy, the food arrives in a timely manner, and service is splendid.  The California Club is my all time favorite pizza. It contains smoked bacon, mozzarella, chicken, topped with fresh lettuce and avocado on top. It's a healthier meal option and doesn't leave me feeling bloated like pizzas from other chain restaurants. It doesn't matter which pizza you get, they never come out covered in grease. The only dessert I've tried is the tiramisu and I don't like it. It has a bitter taste and just doesn't hit the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Mark G.,"Roanoke, TX",35,456,2,3.0,9/18/2014,Haven't eaten at CPK since I lived in CA.  I've had their frozen pizzas after moving away from CA and enjoyed them for what they were so I figured I'd give the restaurant another try after all these years.  I had the Sicilian pizza.  It was good.  Definitely better than frozen but nothing special really.  Like another reviewer said here it seemed to be lacking something...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Jennifer S.,"Kansas City, MO",79,104,21,2.0,1/3/2014,"Well, the niece said it was the best pizza she had ever had!   I on the other hand was satisfied enough to get full with my cardboard and peppers.  For a chain it's ok.  With the menu over priced and the servers lacking any experience at all... I would rather stay home with the frozen pizza in the oven.  No offense to anyone who enjoys it - but I am a pizza stickler for all things dough and it would have been better to spend the money at a local joint like D'Bronx or Record Bar's Pizza.  Ps- Niece also said the Sprite was the best she ever had too......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Carrie C.,"Kansas City, MO",104,148,52,4.0,11/21/2013,"I really like the location of California Pizza Kitchen. I only wish that the Plaza had easier parking along Ward Parkway. Such a pain. But I digress. I came here a couple weeks ago with a friend from work for lunch and ordered the turkey club on focaccia and an order of fried macaroni as a starter. While my company was on the strange side (he's an interesting young man, to say the least), I enjoyed my visit. Our food came out pretty quickly, and our waitress kept our glasses full while we waited. The macaroni bites came out first and were so so good. They were piping hot with a crispy bread crumb crust and drizzled with a little bit of extra cheese - I'll definitely be ordering these again! My sandwich came out soon after we finished the macaroni bites and I dove in. The thing was bigger than I expected, so I only ate half, but the bread was incredible. I absolutely loved the seasoning and texture, which was soft yet slightly crispy on the outside. The dressing that came on it had great flavor and the turkey was well seasoned and wasn't dry, which I'm always afraid of when ordering turkey breast (definitely a dark meat fan, here).  Overall, my experience here was good. For being my first visit to chain like this, I'd definitely be okay with coming back soon, especially to try some of the pizza they're named for and FOR SURE to order some more of those macaroni bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Paul M.,"Overland Park, KS",262,195,35,4.0,6/9/2013,Sure it's a chain.   But it's a good chain.  And they keep it clean.  that counts for a lot. A great deal for the money and always a special treat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city

Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",731,1014,2378,3.0,5/30/2012,"You been to one CPK, you've been to them all, right?  Well, almost.  This CPK has very good service, friendly waitstaff, and are very accommodating of special dietary request.  Also has affordable wine options.  Dining at the plaza usually involves a rather serious line, so it's nice to finally be seated and have nice waiters.  Food is good in a heavy calorie inducing coma kind of way.  I recommend the Field Greens salad (pears and candied walnuts tossed in homemade Dijon balsamic vinaigrette) with Gorgonzola added.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Wayne F.,"Kansas City, MO",12,8,,4.0,8/16/2014,"Had a hand tossed pepperoni pizza, just a bit greasy, but great tasting. My gf had a spinach and quinoa salad with dried tomatoes and onion.

Kenna B.,"West Des Moines, IA",47,117,80,4.0,12/25/2011,"My first CPK experience was a take out order when one of the organizations I'm involved in held a fundraiser here.  It was the middle of the afternoon, I was the only soul in the restaurant, and I had the undivided attention of the staff.  Everyone was super helpful and friendly. I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza, because I was familiar with it from the freezer section of the grocery store.  It's even better from their oven (super yummy!), and it didn't take a long time to cook.  While I was waiting I popped open my computer, and discovered they offer FREE WIRELESS INTERNET - score! I also had an Italian Soda, which was horrible.  The girl didn't mix it, and by the time I figured that out, the syrup was history.  You do get free refills though.  I also ordered the tiramisu, which was good (not the best I've had, but not the worst either). My second visit was a dine in visit with a friend.  We were planning on it being a working dinner, but after we saw them fill up quickly we cleared out after our meal.  I ordered the pizza salad (can't remember the name), and it was really good.  Overall, I was impressed with the quality of food, but the service on this visit was lacking.  The waitress seemed angry at the world - maybe she was just having a bad day? I will definitely be back to try more deliciousness that is CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Fabiana Z.,"Olathe, KS",35,52,22,4.0,12/27/2013,"Consistently tasty fresh pizza. Service is usually pretty good as well. The best thing is that the kiddos love it and always enjoy it! Ordered the BLT and the original chicken barbecue pizza. Bacon was crisp, avocados were fresh and crust was delicious. Miller light was served in an ice cold glass. Dessert was a bit on the pre-produced side but again, the kiddos liked it. Happy kids, Happy mom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Jeff H.,"Kansas City, MO",4,66,18,4.0,7/4/2011,"This CPK location is surely committed to quality. On one occasion, after I had voraciously consumed half a very tasty Pizza Margherita, the manager brought another one unannounced and at no charge, explaining that the first pizza was not up to their usual standards.  Uhmmm... OK! I'm very much a pizza snob and a traditionalist who believes pineapples don't belong on pizzas.  CPK, however, is different, versatile and high-quality enough to pull off a very diverse menu with great expertise. With my traditional Italian roots, I love the Pizza Margherita, which is Italian tomatoes and mozzarella and fresh basil.   My other favorite is the BBQ Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon and goat cheese.  I've also tried the Pear & Gongonzola with Fontina, Mozzarella, caramelized onions and hazelnuts, a very interesting creation. I don't know that I'm up for all of the combinations CPK offers, but I also believe anything they produce will be top-notch and good.  Parking in the Plaza garage, entrance just north of CPK's door, can be a time-consuming maze.  Bring walking shoes and a GPS.  Get here early and you might be lucky enough to get a place on the street.  Whatever... CPK is well worth the parking hassle. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Cory M.,"Kansas City, KS",220,81,15,5.0,12/30/2011,Good service and taste. For a chain they've made this one seem more intimate than others. Servers are easy on the eyes too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city

witty b.,"Mission, KS",0,34,1,5.0,1/12/2013,"My new favorite pizza joint.  Only eaten there once but it is the best pizza I've had since I was a kid.  It is gets expensive if you order soft drinks and dessert.  The pizza is about the size of a Tony's frozen pizza so only 6 slices.  It looks like they use a brick oven to cook it in which makes the perfect crust.  We went NewYrs Eve early in the evening and the weather wasn't very good so there wasn't a line.  The service was good.   Three pizzas, 5 soft drinks, 4 desserts came to $80. I will definitely eat their pizza again, but  I will probably do carry out next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
Sharlene T.,"Kansas City, MO",3,9,7,1.0,10/5/2013,"Didn't have a good experience here. The only thing good was the crust. Everything else was tasteless; food that tastes like it came out of a machine. Didn't even enjoy the guacamole with chips, something you can't go wrong with. Chips tasted like those you buy in the grocery store, while the guac tasted like just mashed avocado with diced potato and defrosted corn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city
B And B Sho W.,"Independence, MO",0,4,,3.0,9/5/2013,"Went and visited for lunch. Hostess was quick to greet, led us to a clean booth for two.  Ordered the pizza pie,  after the short arrival, the very first slice to pick from, I noticed a piece of plastic attached to the food.  I informed the waitress, mgr came to visit as well.

It's been two weeks in KC and I'm itching to go back. I like the bbq chopped salad, bbq chicken pizza and spinach dips and order those things everysingle time. Today however Nichole chose pizza with Shrimp. Shrimp? I mean pizza with shrimp? I was skeptical and hence ordered a full sized bbq chicken salad, but it was pretty good.
